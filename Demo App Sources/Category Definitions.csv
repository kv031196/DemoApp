In some cases, it may include other types of centre, eg honeycomb. This also includes all other selflines, many of which have liquid/soft centres, such as cream or caramel.

Standard boxed assortments and twist wrapped miniatures are included. Standard boxed assortment includes assortments which are typically adult-orientated rather than being intended for children. Popular formats include picture boxes, liqueurs, pralines and bouchées. Also includes products where the chocolates contained therein are identical. Please note that jars and tins are also included, if meeting the product criteria detailed above. Likewise, products sold in paper bags can be included here if they are perceived to be equivalent to a traditional boxed assortment and/or the product belongs to a range/brand family that is generally considered a boxed assortment.

Leading global brands include Kinder Surprise (Ferrero Group), Perugina (Nestlé SA), Cadbury Yowie’s (Mondelez International Inc)."
Snacks,2023,      Countlines,3,"Chocolate bars eaten as snacks. Many are filled and unsegmented (ie not pre-cut into smaller pieces/segments). Typical examples include Snickers and Mars. Countlines can be sold in a diversity of formats, including multipacks or mini-fun sizes that are not twist-wrapped and not sold in boxes. Miniaturised twist-wrapped versions of countline brands sold in a boxed assortment format should be included under boxed assortments. Other products in this category include wafer bars (typically KitKat), and cereal/muesli bars coated with chocolate (eg Afghans), as well as items such as Nutella and Go. However, cereal/muesli bars, which are nutritionally fortified and coated with chocolate will fall under snack bars (typically energy bars). Alfajores are excluded (see above). Countlines also includes any individually wrapped product that is packaged in single serve format so that it can be consumed within one sitting (e.g. Freddo’s, Bon o Bons). We exclude any individually wrapped products that are aimed at a seasonal market (e.g. Crème Eggs) – these would be counted as seasonal chocolate. Multiple individually wrapped products stored in boxes or pouches would be counted as boxed assortments or chocolate pouches and bags respectively. Similarly to KitKat, brand Hanuta (Ferrero) is included in this category and not in Wafers, as primarily positioned alongside other countlines and designed for impulse purchase. Brands of chocolate tablet bars that are mainly positioned and designed as a snack (examples: Kinder Maxi/Riegel and Kinder Country) are included. However, brands of chocolate tablet bars that are clearly positioned as tablets through their packaging (mainly sold in multiple quantities) and often through their placement in the store, such as Kinder Chocolate and Yogurette, are excluded and fall under tablets.

Selection boxes and hollow moulded figures for Christmas as well as for other occasions (eg Easter, Halloween, Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, New Year’s etc) are also included. Easter eggs with toys are excluded and fall under chocolate with toys). Leading examples include Lindt Gold Bunny (Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprüngli AG), Lindt Golden Santa (Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprüngli AG), Cadbury’s Crème Egg (Mondelez International Inc) and Kinder Santa (Ferrero Group)."
Snacks,2023,      Tablets,3,"Moulded and segmented chocolate bars in a wide range of sizes ranging from bite-size to family bars. Some are filled with nuts and/or raisins and made of different types of chocolate ie white, milk and dark. Others are simply plain. Plain dark chocolate is made of cocoa powder, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, and sugar. The higher the percentage of cocoa solids, the better the quality. Good quality dark chocolate contains at least 60 per cent to 70 per cent cocoa solids. This is the chocolate most often used for premium chocolate confections. Besides cocoa mass it contains added cocoa butter, sugar, vanilla and lecithin. Plain milk chocolate has milk added. It contains 30 per cent to 40 per cent cocoa solids, sugar and milk White chocolate is made of cocoa butter, milk, and sugar. Although it has a similar texture to chocolate and can be used in chocolate recipes, purists don't consider it to be chocolate because it does not contain cocoa solids. Because white chocolate has no cocoa solids from the chocolate liquor, regulatory institutions such as the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) also do not classify it as chocolate. However, the organisation is currently working with chocolate manufacturers to establish a standard definition for white chocolate. Tablets in a linear segmented countline format are included eg Cadbury’s Dairy Milk (Mondelez), Galaxy (Mars) or Toblerone (Mondelez) because they are pre-cut (or moulded) into individual bite-sized segments. Miniaturised twist-wrapped versions of tablet brands sold in multipack assortments (typically boxed) format should be included boxed assortments (ie, Toblerone One by One). However, non-twist wrapped mini versions (such as the Toblerone product immediately below) should still be captured under tablets. Leading global brands include Milka (Mondelez International Inc), Toblerone (Mondelez International Inc) Cadbury’s Dairy Milk (Mondelez International Inc), Ritter Sport (Ritter GmbH & Co KG, Alfred), Hershey’s Milk Chocolate (Hershey Co, The), Côte d’Or (Mondelez International Inc), Lindt Excellence (Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprüngli AG). Tablet formats that are a smaller version of a standard tablet product, typically positioned for impulse purchase, are included in this category. Example: Green & Black’s 35 g. Brands of chocolate tablet bars that are clearly positioned as tablets through their packaging (mainly sold in multiple quantities) and often through their placement in the store, such as Kinder Chocolate and Yogurette, are also included here. However, if a brand of chocolate tablet bars is mainly positioned and designed as a snack (examples: Kinder Maxi/Riegel and Kinder Country) then it falls under Countlines. Tablets positioned as for baking/cooking and placed in the aisle as such, are excluded."

Snacks,2023,      Mints,3,This is the aggregation of standard and power mints.

Fruit roll-ups, fruit rippers, fruit winders and the like are also excluded (these are under fruit bars). Note: Pastilles which are tablets/small candies, though soft on the inside, are coated on the outside. The main difference between pastilles and chews/gums/jellies is that the latter does not have an outer covering. One of the clearest brand examples is fruit-flavoured Tic Tac (Ferrero). It is this hard-shell on the outside that differentiates pastilles from gums, jellies and chews. Leading global brands include Starburst (Mars), Y&S Twizzler in fruit flavours (Hershey), Skittles (Mars), Haribo (Haribo GmbH) and Mentos Fruit (Perfetti Van Melle)."

2. Clear website positioning 
3. Commercials from no more than 18 months back from the research time.

Snacks,2023,    Unpackaged Ice Cream,2,"Unpackaged ice cream covers ice cream that is not pre-packaged prior to being sold to the consumers.

Unpackaged ice cream foodservice includes all sales of unpackaged ice cream from foodservice outlets whether they make their own ice cream or buy it unpackaged. Ice cream parlours, either chained or independent, are considered as foodservice outlets. For example, a Haagen-Dazs foodservice outlet which sells scoops of ice cream would not be included in retail value and volume sizes, it would only be included in foodservice volume sales. In retail channels, these products are largely unbranded, so company/brand shares should be 100% artisanal. As a result they are mostly produced on the site of purchase. They can be bought either for impulse or take-home consumption. Foodservice sales are defined as sales to foodservice outlets. However, for foodservice unpackaged ice cream, this does not always apply as the ice cream may be made on-site, in which case an exception is made here.

Note: Nestlé Crunch Ice Cream Nuggets and similar such products are also included here. The product consists of single ice cream portions packaged in a tub, for later consumption at home.
