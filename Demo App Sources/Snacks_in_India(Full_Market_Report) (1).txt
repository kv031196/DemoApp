SNACKS IN INDIA - INDUSTRY
OVERVIEW
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Snacks in 2022: The big picture
For the snacks industry in India, 2022 has been a difficult year for manufacturers in terms of
increasing sales and maintaining operating profit. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation
has increased globally, which has in turn dented private consumption. Retail current value
growth in 2022 is expected to be driven mainly by increases in unit prices, with retail volume
growth slowing. According to Euromonitor International estimates, inflation is approaching 7% in
India in 2022, which has driven up the unit prices of snacks. The war in Ukraine has also caused
a shortage of sunflower oil, which has led snacks manufacturers to resort to using palm oil. The
rising demand for palm oil and other edible oils has also led to increases in their unit prices.
Consumers did foresee increases in prices, leading them to stock up in the first half of the year
for fear of price rises. Apart from the cost of ingredients, there have also been increases in
packaging costs, freight costs and manpower costs.
Considering rises in prices which are not proportionate to the rise in per capita income,
consumers are trading down to cheaper alternatives, unpackaged food products, or trading
down to smaller pack sizes. Also in 2022, COVID-19-led restrictions have eased, which has led
to more out-of-home consumption occasions, with foodservice operations returning to normal.
All these factors in conjunction are limiting the growth of snacks in retail in 2022. Due to rising
inflation, rural demand for snacks has also declined in 2022. In order to cater to consumersâ
demands, manufacturers are also introducing more value-sized products. Due to this shift in
purchasing behaviour, whilst mass products have not suffered as much, sales of premium
products are stagnating.

Key trends in 2022
In the last few years, there has been a rise in the number of health-conscious consumers,
partly due to COVID-19. People are now more conscious of what they consume in terms of
ingredients, calorie count, sustainability, and quality. In response, manufacturers are in turn
having to be more mindful of their manufacturing processes, as the quality of products is a strict
criterion for consumption. Nutrition labels are also being read more carefully by consumers.
According to Euromonitorâs Lifestyles Survey, more than two thirds of respondents are looking
for healthy ingredients in food and beverages in 2022, and half of respondents closely read the
labels of food and beverages in India. Witnessing the demand for healthier packaged food
items, manufacturers are launching millet-based, non-fried, and low calorie snacks. For
example, Urban Platterâs Millet Sticks, Munch Fit Millet roasted snacks, TruMillets and Mighty
Millets bars are gaining popularity in the Indian market.

Competitive landscape
In 2022, due to rising inflation, the companies which have been able to optimise their costs
and strengthen their distribution networks have performed well in India. Bigger brands such as
Parle, Britannia and Sunfeast, which have high brand recall, have been able to maintain their
leading positions due to sustained demand, while smaller brands and start-ups have relied
mainly on the e-commerce channel for their sales.

Introducing new products that resonate with value-conscious and middle-income customers
has also been a crucial strategy for key players. Mass player Britannia Industries introduced
Marie Gold Jeera to cater to regional customers in South India, ITC launched Sunfeast All
Rounder, PepsiCo launched new Lays in chilli flavours, and Mondelez introduced Oreo Double
Stuff, to target mass consumers in India. While mass manufacturers have leveraged regional
flavours to gain share, the importance of healthy ingredients such as millet also continues to be
a growing option to attract consumers. Regional manufacturers and start-ups such as Happilo,
Paper Boat and Terra have introduced snacks made of millet, processed vegetables and other
healthy ingredients.

Channel developments
In 2022, store-based retailing continues to be the dominant distribution channel in the Indian
market. Modern grocery channels such as supermarkets, hypermarkets and convenience stores
are set to continue growing in 2022, because of the offers they pass on to their customers.
Customers are able to take advantage of cashback, discounts, offers such as buy-one-get-onefree, and use their credit cards at modern grocery retailers, which makes it convenient for them
to shop in such outlets. These stores have also expanded their footprint across tier-2 and tier-3
cities in India, thus engaging more customers. Meanwhile, small local grocers are set to lose
share in 2022, although this channel will remain dominant.
Nevertheless, e-commerce is set to continue to grow within snacks in 2022, due to prompt
delivery services and various offers. Although growth in e-commerce tends to be limited to tier-1
cities in India, the entry of bigger players, such as Reliance through JioMart, Tata through
BigBasket, and Amazon Fresh, has also increased penetration in tier-2 markets. In urban areas,
the quick delivery services provided by Swiggy, Instamart, Zepto, Fraazo, etc. have made
ordering through e-commerce apps quicker and easier.

What next for snacks?
Favourable socioeconomic factors are expected to increase the affordability of packaged food
in the forecast years, leading to the higher growth of the organised market than the unorganised
market. Whilst consumers in India will continue to be mindful of what they are eating in terms of
calorie count, origin of ingredients and nutritional labels, out-of-home consumption occasions
are expected to rise, as consumers are likely to lead increasingly hectic lifestyles. In the forecast
period, with the end of the pandemic, normal activities such as travelling, and commuting to and
from the office, will resume, and alongside, so will the demand for snacks.

CHOCOLATE CONFECTIONERY IN
INDIA - CATEGORY ANALYSIS
KEY DATA FINDINGS
âª Retail value sales rise by 11% in current terms in 2022 to INR155 billion
âª Boxed assortments is the best performing category in 2022, with retail value sales rising by
15% in current terms to INR7.6 billion
âª Mondelez India Foods Pvt Ltd is the leading player in 2022, with a retail value share of 57%
âª Retail sales are set to grow at a current value CAGR of 9% (2022 constant value CAGR of
4%) over the forecast period to INR237 billion

2022 DEVELOPMENTS
The snacking habit continues even after the pandemic
As the initial COVID-19 lockdowns led consumers to be secluded at home and spend a lot
more time at home than usual, they turned to snacking as a source of comfort. The number of
consumption occasions increased, and consumers started replacing meals with snacks. This
has trickled down into 2022, even though educational institutes and some offices have reopened
and resumed operations. Indians now prefer smaller meals throughout the day, and the trend of
replacing at least one meal with a snack is on the rise, driving retail growth. Indulgence is
another reason snacking is becoming increasingly popular. However, consumers in India have
also become more aware of their sugar intake and are mindful about portion intake; because of
this, chocolate pouches and bags witnessed stronger sales during the pandemic, and retail
volume and current value growth are set to continue in 2022.

Omnichannel development for chocolate confectionery
The pandemic disrupted the distribution landscape for chocolate confectionery and gave
impetus to e-commerce. As consumers started shopping online because of the restrictions on
movement, this led many manufacturers to also focus on their online channels. Despite the
easing of the pandemic, consumers continue to purchase chocolate confectionery online, citing
convenience as a main reason. Platforms such as Swiggy and Blinkit, with their quick service
and short delivery times, are becoming a popular choice for customers demanding convenience.
However, due to the nature of chocolate confectionery, which requires temperature-controlled
storage, hypermarkets and supermarkets are also becoming popular amongst consumers,
catering especially to the demand for dark chocolate and premium chocolate. With the easing of
lockdowns and the situation in the country returning to normality, and educational institutions
resuming their operations, out of home consumption is also expected to regain its strong growth
momentum in 2022, driving sales through traditional channels. Along with this, rapid digital
transformation will lead kirana stores (small local grocers) to remain the most prominent channel
in chocolate confectionery in 2022.

Mondelez continues to lead, due to strong brand recall and trust
amongst consumers
Mondelez India Foods is expected to remain the leader in chocolate confectionery in 2022,
and will continue to extend its value share. This can be attributed to strong brand recall and trust
amongst consumers. The pandemic saw consumers gravitate towards trusted brands, which is
also boosting the sales of the company. It benefits from its strong brand portfolio, which includes
Cadbury Dairy Milk, Cadbury Dairy Milk Silk, Cadbury Celebrations, Bournville, 5 Star, Cadbury
Perk, and Cadbury Gems. The company is also witnessing healthy sales riding on the back of
its vast product range, as it has products across all price segments and pack sizes. The
company also continues to launch new products. The latest addition was Cadbury Dairy Milk
Silk Bubble-gum, a product with bubble gum filling and chocolate outer coating. Mondelez is
quick to understand evolving consumer preferences, and launches new variants to tap into
demand. Such innovations keep the company relevant amongst consumers.
Another reason for strong brand recall is the marketing campaigns and activations carried out
by Mondelez. Following its new launch Cadbury Dairy Milk Silk Bubble-gum, the company
supported it with the #BubbledUpWithFun campaign, which was a 360 degree campaign which
involved increasing in-store visibility and outdoor activations. The company also tapped into the
superhero fandom and comic culture, which has recently seen huge growth. With the release of
the film The Batman, the company collaborated with DC to offer consumers an immersive trip to
Gotham City in Warner Bros World in Abu Dhabi. The company also understands its customers
and target audience. One such example is the âDo Nothingâ campaign, which aimed to fight the
pressure of celebrating Valentineâs Day for single people. At the same time, the company also
ran the campaign #HowFarWillYouGoToMakeThemBlush, which used personalised augmented
reality technology, which the company claimed was the first in the country, enabling customers
to send messages secretly to their loved ones. The company also turns to consumers for input
on new flavours; the company runs a campaign Madbury, whereby consumers can post about
ideas for new products or flavours. Moving forward, the company aims to penetrate rural areas
with smaller pack sizes.

PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Healthy chocolate confectionery set to see demand in the future
Premium chocolate confectionery is gaining traction in India. Consumers are becoming
portion-conscious and prefer bite-sized chocolate, whilst dark chocolate is also seeing rapid
consumer acceptance. This type of chocolate confectionery, which is considered healthier,
appeals to the mindful eating trend amongst Indian consumers. Another reason for the rising
popularity of dark chocolate is that it is perceived as guilt-free by consumers owing to the
reduced sugar content. According to Euromonitor Internationalâs health and nutrition survey,
60% of survey respondents think avoiding sugar is better for them, while 58% say that avoiding
sugar makes them feel healthier, whereas 57% say that they avoid sugar for weight
management. The purported health benefits of dark chocolate include reducing the risk of blood
pressure and lowering cholesterol, which makes it ideal for health-conscious consumers.
Considering the demand for this type of chocolate amongst health-conscious consumers, many
companies are adding dark chocolate variants to their portfolios. In addition, new companies,
such as Wellversed under its brand Ketofy, as well as Zevic, Bogatchi, Ditch The Guilt and Mojo
Thins, alongside many other brands, have started selling on online marketplaces such as
Amazon. Moving forward, the demand for healthy chocolate confectionery is expected to see
rapid growth.

Rural areas remain key to future growth
Sales of chocolate confectionery in India are largely driven by urban consumers, due to
accessibility and availability, along with having the spending power to consume premium
chocolate confectionery. However, the urban market is now fairly saturated, and manufacturers
are now turning towards semi-rural and rural areas for further growth. The penetration of
chocolate confectionery is still very low in these areas due to the lack of infrastructure and the
nature of the product, which requires temperature control or refrigeration. According to
Euromonitor International, the per capita consumption of chocolate confectionery is 360g per
person, which is very low compared with developed countries, where per capita consumption is
in the range of 5-10kg per person per annum. This provides huge potential for manufacturers to
grow. Manufacturers such as Mondelez and Mars are looking to expand in rural areas to
maintain growth, with their strategy being to offer products at a lower price point to gain share
from unorganised players. Distribution in these areas also remains an area for improvement for
manufacturers in India, and such companies plan to strengthen their distribution in these
regions.

GUM IN INDIA - CATEGORY ANALYSIS
KEY DATA FINDINGS
âª Retail value sales increase by 6% in current terms in 2022 to INR20.0 billion
âª Chewing gum is the best performing category in 2022, with retail value sales rising by 6% in
current terms to INR8.4 billion
âª Perfetti Van Melle India Pvt Ltd is the leading player in 2022, with a retail value share of 70%
âª Retail sales are set to grow at a current value CAGR of 4% (2022 constant value CAGR of 1%) over the forecast period to INR23.9 billion

2022 DEVELOPMENTS
Increase in mobility leads to recovery in sales of gum
The pandemic led to almost flat retail current value sales of gum in India in 2020, but as the
lockdown restrictions were gradually lifted, sales of gum saw an uptick in 2021, with growth also
expected in 2022 in both retail volume and current value terms. Gum, being an impulse
purchase, depends primarily on mobility. Sales in this category are also aided by store-based
retail channels, where gum is strategically placed at the checkouts. As these products are more
of an on-the-go purchase, sales witnessed growth as educational institutions and offices
resumed their operations. The reopening of schools in particular has provided an impetus to
sales, as children are regular consumers of gum. The reopening of workplaces also means that
sales through tobacco shops are resuming, which were non-existent in the peak pandemic
period. As consumersâ lives return to pre-pandemic patterns, with increased mobility and a
return to travel, gum is set to witness solid growth in 2022.

Perfetti Van Melle continues to lead gum in 2022
Perfetti Van Melle is expected to continue to dominate gum in 2022, owing to its strong
portfolio, which includes brands such as Center Fruit, Center Fresh, Happydent and Big Babol.
The company keeps innovating as consumer demand evolves. The company has invested in
television as its biggest avenue for advertising, followed by digital and then by other formats,
such as print and outdoor. The company has also increased its spending as mobility has now
returned and consumers are stepping outside of their homes. The company also plans a new
campaign for its brand Center Fresh.
According to Euromonitor International, rural households are still dominant in India. Perfetti
Van Melle therefore sees significant growth opportunity in rural areas, and aims to expand its
geographic presence. With this in mind, the company is running multiple pilot projects; one such
example is a project with ElasticRun, which is an e-commerce platform for kirana (small grocery
stores), to reach western parts of India, where the company does not have a strong rural
presence. Going forward, the company will continue to innovate in products and continue with
its rural expansion.

Potential for growth via health-positioned variants
Gum is a mature category in India, and has very limited avenues for innovation. This is the
primary reason for subdued sales pre-pandemic. However, with consumers becoming
increasingly health-conscious, especially with issues related to sugar consumption, this presents
an opportunity for growth in this category. Consumers are facing issues such as obesity,
diabetes, and heart diseases, and as a result, manufacturers are looking into introducing sugarfree variants of their gum brands to appeal to more health-conscious consumers. In recent
years, there has already been a strong increase in the number of gum products with reduced
sugar claims. In addition, as consumers start to look for more than just sugar-free variants,
manufacturers will be able to position their products as healthy or fortified, offering functional
benefits to consumers. Oral health could be one area for manufacturers to explore. With the
lockdown easing and increased mobility, and as state governments are also stating that wearing
masks is not compulsory, sales of gum are poised to increase in the forecast period in both
retail volume and current value terms.

Players set to focus on strengthening distribution to increase
geographical reach
The further strengthening of distribution networks will be key for gum players to maximise
their performances over the forecast period. According to Euromonitor Internationalâs socio data,
63% of Indian households are still rural, which makes this a huge market for expansion. Also,
the penetration of established brands in rural areas remains low, with most of them focusing on
urban expansion in the past. India is a vast geographically and socially diverse country, which
presents significant obstacles and challenges to companies looking to develop a nationwide
presence. During the review period, the major players in gum, including Perfetti Van Melle and
Wrigley, continued to work to strengthen the distribution of their gum products, even in rural
areas. The category leader, Perfetti Van Melle, did this by leveraging the strength of its broader
confectionery offerings to encourage retailers to stock its gum products. Further work will be
needed during the forecast period to raise consumersâ awareness of gum and to make such
products more accessible to consumers across the country.

SUGAR CONFECTIONERY IN INDIA CATEGORY ANALYSIS
KEY DATA FINDINGS
âª Retail value sales rise by 8% in current terms in 2022 to INR109 billion
âª Pastilles, gums, jellies and chews is the best performing category in 2022, with retail value
sales increasing by 13% in current terms to INR15.0 billion
âª Parle Products Pvt Ltd is the leading player in 2022, with a retail value share of 17%
âª Retail sales are set to rise at a current value CAGR of 7% (2022 constant value CAGR of 2%)
over the forecast period to INR155 billion

2022 DEVELOPMENTS
Increase in mobility to drive sales of sugar confectionery in 2022
The COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns and restrictions in 2020, which confined
consumers to their homes. As a high proportion of sales was accounted for by impulse on-thego consumption, this negatively affected retail volume sales in 2020. There was also a definite
shift of sales towards e-commerce, as consumers preferred the safety and convenience
associated with this channel. E-commerce therefore took share from impulse channels such as
small local grocers. As the restrictions eased and people felt more comfortable stepping out of
their homes, and mobility increased, retail sales of sugar confectionery witnessed an uptick in
volume and current value terms in 2021, and further growth is expected in 2022.
The reopening of educational institutions and the return of children to school is the main factor
driving sales, as children are the primary target group for sugar confectionery. Increased athome consumption has reverted to out-of-home impulse consumption. Pastilles, gummies,
jellies and chews is set to witness the fastest value growth amongst all sugar confectionery
categories in 2022, as these are consumed by all age groups, unlike other large categories,
such as boiled sweets. In addition, pastilles, gummies, jellies and chews come in fortified or
immunity-boosting variants, which are also preferred by health-conscious consumers.

Demographics to play an important role in the growth of sugar
confectionery
Sugar confectionery is essentially an impulse category in India, and the main consumers of
such products continue to be young children. However, this has been changing in recent times,
along with the launch of multiple flavours and formats. Sugar confectionery now has mass
appeal, as consumers are from all age groups. Sugar confectionery remains the preferred
choice for treats, as these products are generally sold in INR1, INR2 and INR5 formats, which
makes for an affordable treat even for people in the low-income segment. Apart from the low
price point, indulgence is also a major driver of sales of sugar confectionery. Consumers prefer
sugar confectionery as a bite-sized dessert and also as an indulgent treat, as many people
continue to work from home. This is in line with the evolving consumption habits of healthconscious consumers in terms of portion control. Indian consumers do not shy away from sugar
confectionery, but are increasingly becoming aware of the sugar content. To tackle this issue

without compromising on taste, portion control is something they are now looking at, which is
driving sales of sugar confectionery.

Parle Products Pvt Ltd continues to lead sugar confectionery
Parle Products is expected to continue to lead sugar confectionery in value terms in 2022,
riding on the back of its strong portfolio and wide distribution throughout the country. However,
at the same time it faces strong competition from ITC, the second biggest player in sugar
confectionery, and the only other player to hold a double-digit value share. Parle Products
leveraged the distribution of its biscuits portfolio to maintain its resilience during the testing
pandemic times. The company pushed sugar confectionery to biscuits distributors to drive sales.
In recent times the company has also increased its geographical presence by expanding into
rural areas and increased its rural penetration to drive sales.

PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Fortification and healthier variants to drive the growth of sugar
confectionery
Consumers in India are increasingly becoming aware of the sugar content in the food
products they consume. Sugar intake has become a major concern, as it is a main reason for
obesity in India. According to Euromonitorâs Health and Nutrition Survey on Reasons to Avoid
Sugar, 58% of Indian consumers said avoiding sugar makes them feel healthier, while 57% said
they avoid sugar for weight loss or weight management. Consumers are therefore increasingly
demanding healthier snacks and reduced/no sugar variants. As a result, sugar confectionery
continues to face strong competition from health-oriented categories. Manufacturers are
responding to this demand by either fortifying their products or reducing the sugar content. For
instance, manufacturers have looked to fortification with vitamins as consumers are looking for
functional benefits. Perfetti Van Melle has launched lollipops and fruit jellies fortified with vitamin
C. As consumers are becoming increasingly health-conscious, this is how manufacturers are
choosing to differentiate themselves, by leveraging their health positioning.

Innovation and cross-formatting to keep consumers interested
Due to the ever-changing demands of consumers, who want something new and exciting in
sugar confectionery, manufacturers need to continuously innovate and keep adding new
flavours and formats to keep consumers interested. Manufacturers are therefore introducing
newer formats and variants. For instance, Perfetti Van Melle has introduced tennis ball-shaped
gum which have a crunchy sugar confectionery coating and a centre filling of pineapple. The
company has introduced this product at a price point of INR2 to cater to the masses. Another
brand, Chupa Chups, has leveraged innovation to cater to customers looking for a differentiated
experience. It has introduced Chupa Chups MixâUp, a dual colour, dual flavoured lollipop. The
brand has also introduced a new product which takes inspiration from multiple categories,
lollipops and bubble gum. Manufacturers will continue to rely on innovation and cross-formatting
to differentiate themselves from the competition.

ICE CREAM IN INDIA - CATEGORY
ANALYSIS
KEY DATA FINDINGS
âª Retail value sales rise by 22% in current terms in 2022 to INR122 billion
âª Take-home ice cream is the best performing category in 2022, with retail value sales
increasing by 23% in current terms to INR43.1 billion
âª Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd is the leading player in 2022, with a retail
value share of 16%
âª Retail sales are set to rise at a current value CAGR of 19% (2022 constant value CAGR of
14%) over the forecast period to INR297 billion

2022 DEVELOPMENTS
Ice cream in India on the road to recovery due to hot summer
Ice cream is expected to see significant retail volume and current value increases in India in
2022, after being particularly hard-hit during the pandemic in 2020, and seeing only slow
recovery in 2021. The primary reason for the expectation of growth in sales of ice cream in 2022
is the heatwaves which swept the country during the summer months, when consumers
resorted to ice cream for relief from the high temperatures. According to the Indian
Meteorological Department (IMD), the average monthly temperature in the month of March 2022
was 33.1Â°C, which was the highest in the last 122 years. Alongside this, pandemic restrictions
have virtually been eliminated, and people have returned to leaving their homes, with the
situation almost back to the pre-COVID-19 level in terms of mobility. This has in turn led to the
revival of out-of-home consumption of ice cream and growth in foodservice volumes. Although
foodservice volumes are not expected to reach the pre-pandemic level of sales until 2023, the
recovery in 2022 is set to continue to be significant. Growth would have been stronger, but due
to supply shortages, the foodservice growth of ice cream has seen a significant slowdown.

Amul retains its lead in ice cream
Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation is expected to maintain its lead in ice cream
in value terms in 2022, thanks to its brand Amul, which is riding on the back of its strong
distribution network and strong financial capability, which is helping it to navigate tough times.
The company continues to innovate and introduce products catering to health-conscious
consumers. It experiments with Indian flavours and ingredients when introducing new products.
It introduced a variant called Isabcool, which has the ingredient isabgol, which aids with
digestion. To keep up with the increasing demand for ice cream, the company plans to double
its production capacity in the next two years. It currently manufactures ice cream at 17 plants in
India, and plans to add nine new locations in the next year. The company is also planning to set
up its first cone-making plant in Surat, Gujarat. It is also benefiting from its growing franchisee
business.

SNACKS IN INDIA

Healthy products continue to see growth in 2022, due to permissible
indulgence
The pandemic has led consumers to become more health-conscious, and this is reflecting in
their food choices. The demand for healthier ice cream variants is on the rise. Products which
have claims or positioning such as natural, free from artificial additives, reduced or no sugar are
increasingly gaining popularity. In recent years, the proliferation of small manufacturers and
artisanal players has been seen in the Indian market. An example of such players is Habbit
Health and Nutrition, which claims that its products have less than 40 calories in each serving,
contain no sugar, and are keto- and diabetic-friendly. Other examples are Minus 30, which
makes vegan and sugar-free ice cream, and Noto, which claims to contain twice the protein and
less sugar than most other ice cream. Other such brands that have emerged in the market
include Good Fettle, Get-A-Whey, Bono, Baked Darzee, Bliss Please, Peko Peko and Nomou.
These brands are not yet pan-India, but are gaining popularity, especially in urban areas. These
manufacturers are catering to the increasing consumer demand for permissible indulgence,
which is gaining popularity amongst increasingly health-conscious Indian consumers.

PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Health positioning to gain popularity, but high unit prices remain A
challenge
People in India, especially those in urban areas, are becoming increasingly conscious about
what they consume. As a result, manufacturers are tapping into this consumer need by
introducing products with health claims, such as low calorie, reduced/no sugar, no artificial
preservatives, etc. There is a proliferation of small brands operating in this space which have
many health claims. However, the unit prices of such products are almost twice those of regular
variants, or even higher. This hampers sales of these products at a mass level, as for the
majority of Indian consumers the price point plays a greater role in their purchasing decision
than health claims. There is therefore a massive opportunity for established players to introduce
products with health claims which are cost-effective to tap into a larger consumer base. At the
moment, healthy ice cream is still a niche and an urban phenomenon, but it has potential for
growth in the forecast period, as consumers look for permissible indulgence, but also products
which are at the same time cost-effective.

E-commerce to gain prominence, riding on the back of quick commerce
The pandemic led consumers to shop online during the testing times in 2020. As a source of
comfort, some turned to confectionery and ice cream for mood management, as these act as
comfort foods. Due to limited mobility and the closure of out-of-home channels, consumers
started to order ice cream online, thus increasing sales of ice cream via e-commerce. This habit
has remained, due to the convenience of this distribution channel and the wide variety of
products available. The growth of e-commerce is primarily being driven by quick commerce,
mainly due to the perishable nature of this product. There is huge potential, as the per capita
consumption of ice cream is low compared with other countries. Quick commerce opens up the
opportunity to push the at-home consumption of ice cream and compete with desserts.
Established brands in India have partnered with quick commerce service providers such as
Swiggy, Zomato, BigBasket, Dunzo and Blinkit. While out-of-home consumption has seen an
uptick due to the increase in mobility as restrictions ease, quick commerce provides an avenue
for manufacturers to also increase at-home consumption.

2022 DEVELOPMENTS
Rise in on-the-go snacking as pandemic-led restrictions are removed
The pandemic restricted the movement of consumers in 2020 and 2021. However, with
Indiaâs successful vaccination drive, the number of cases has come under control in 2022, thus
leading to the removal of COVID-19 restrictions on travel, offices, and other such activities. With
the resumption of the movement of people, on-the-go snacking occasions for the consumption
of savoury snacks such as potato chips and puffed snacks have increased, thus contributing to
retail volume and current value growth. However, rising inflation and resultant increases in unit
prices have limited the rate of growth, as savoury snacks have become more expensive.

Manufacturers try to control operating costs amidst rising inflation
Rising inflation, triggered by the war in Ukraine, led to price inflation for edible oils, wheat and
sugar, as well as other components, such as packaging. Rising crude oil prices also led to rises
in freight costs, which ultimately led to a considerable increase in production costs for
manufacturers. Because of high price-sensitivity amongst Indian consumers, manufacturers
have been wary of raising the unit prices of savoury snacks, as it might have a negative impact
on consumption. Amidst this situation, companies tried to control their operating costs while
passing on the minimum possible price rises to customers. The product portfolios of these
companies also became more focused on mass products.

Rising e-commerce penetration in tier-1 cities creates more opportunity
for start-ups
Witnessing the huge potential of savoury snacks in India, in conjunction with the easy
funding/financing options available, many start-ups and regional players have emerged in the
market in recent years. However, these start-ups are primarily limited to urban areas in India,
since they are leveraging e-commerce channels, where they have more visibility and are
accessible to Indian consumers, as opposed to setting up a distribution network from scratch.

PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Consumers migrate from the unorganised to organised market, citing
quality
The pandemic has accelerated demand, whilst bringing into focus the importance of quality
controlled packaged food in India. Consumers now are more aware of the hygienic packaging,
quality ingredients and nutritional value of packaged products. This rise in consumer awareness
is expected to translate into increased responsibility for manufacturers to control their quality
while maintaining their prices. In the forecast years, the growth of the organised market is
expected to be higher than the unorganised market for the aforementioned reasons, thus driving
the continued retail volume and current value growth of savoury snacks.

Rural demand to drive growth in the forecast period
Players in savoury snacks, such as PepsiCo, Haldiram Foods International, Bikaji Foods
International and Balaji Wafers, have been targeting the rural population with smaller packaging,
regional flavours, and elaborate distribution networks, along with targeted marketing efforts,
leading to greater brand awareness and loyalty. The prices of their products are also aimed at
the affordability of the mass rural market in India. This strategy has increased penetration in the
rural market, and demand is expected to grow further in the future. Balaji, which was a regional
brand, has grown due to offering more weight at the same price point as its competitors, and
has grown due to this strategy. Other companies, such as Parle and ITC, offer packs of savoury
snacks at INR5, INR10 and INR20, which are popular options for mass consumers. With
increasing awareness and rising hygiene-consciousness amongst rural consumers, to move to
packaged savoury snacks is expected to drive growth in the forecast period.

Growth of e-commerce to provide A boost to the category
In spite of the large market, there is still low penetration of e-commerce in India. E-commerce
companies such as Zepto, Instamart and Dunzo are working towards reducing their delivery
time while maintaining a low delivery cost. The operating hours of these websites are also
extending â most of them now operate until 01.00hrs. Thus, these websites provide a good
platform for customers who want a quick solution for their midnight craving or for last-minute
purchases. With the competition building in this space, the service providers are only expected
to become more efficient in terms of delivery time and price point offered â thus onboarding
more customers. This phenomenon is expected to attract more consumers, thus providing a
growth opportunity for savoury snacks manufacturers in India.

SWEET BISCUITS, SNACK BARS AND
FRUIT SNACKS IN INDIA - CATEGORY
ANALYSIS
KEY DATA FINDINGS
âª Retail value sales rise by 4% in current terms in 2022 to INR486 billion
âª Snack bars is the best performing category in 2022, with retail value sales increasing by 14%
in current terms to INR1.6 billion
âª Britannia Industries Ltd is the leading player in 2022, with a retail value share of 27%
âª Retail sales are set to increase at a current value CAGR of 9% (2022 constant value CAGR of
4%) over the forecast period to INR753 billion

2022 DEVELOPMENTS
Increase in operating costs leads to price rises
Rising inflation, and increases in raw materials prices, labour costs, packaging costs and
freight costs, have led to overall increases in operating costs for manufacturers of sweet
biscuits, snack bars and fruit snacks. Companies have not been able to absorb these rising
costs and have passed them on to customers, resulting in price rises for products in 2022.
Although companies have tried to limit the rises as much as possible, customers have noticed
prices increasing. Alternatively, some manufacturers have reduced the weight of their products,
while keeping the price constant. In 2022, this is expected to lead to continued retail current
value growth for manufacturers, whilst volume growth is set to stagnate.

Price-sensitive customers trade down to cheaper alternatives
Following rises in the prices of products, price-sensitive consumers have traded down to
cheaper options, smaller pack sizes or substitutes. Since products such as sweet biscuits,
snack bars and fruit snacks have more price elasticity, volume consumption has stagnated
along with price hikes. Indian consumers, mainly from tier-3 cities and rural areas, have lower
incomes per household. Hence, following price rises, demand has declined. However,
consumers in tier-1 cities are less price-sensitive because of relatively higher incomes. Amidst
the changing dynamics of customer preferences and changes in buying behaviour, some
manufacturers have struggled to maintain their shares. A few brands launched new mass
products with regional flavours in an attempt to capture share â for instance Britannia introduced
Marie Gold Jeera biscuits, whilst Bonn Group launched 65g packets of biscuits priced at INR10.

PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Innovations in flavours, packaging and ingredients to drive growth
In an effort to capture more share, manufacturers are constantly innovating with new
products, and this is set to continue. With the increasing health-consciousness of customers and

the mindful eating trend, manufacturers now have a defined target group which is willing to pay
a premium for quality products. Companies are therefore constantly trying to improve their
products in terms of calorific value, nutritional value, and taste, while also making their products
more sustainable by reducing the plastic in their packaging, reducing their carbon footprint, and
using indigenous ingredients such as millet. These innovations have piqued the interest of urban
consumers, and this is expected to continue in the forecast years. Due to hectic lifestyles and
growth in per capita income amongst urban customers, the demand for healthy sweet biscuits,
snack bars and fruit snacks is expected to increase, which will drive the growth of the category
in both retail volume and current value terms.

Start-ups and regional players to contribute to growth
Witnessing the huge growth potential of the total addressable market in India in terms of
potential customers and consumer segments, many start-ups and regional players have entered
this category. These manufacturers provide value in terms of product differentiation, such as low
calorie, no preservatives, no harmful chemicals, sugar-free, zero-waste production, etc. Many of
these ventures have been successful and have gained share in sweet biscuits, snack bars and
fruit snacks. This trend, in conjunction with easy financing options, such as government
financing for small and medium enterprises, venture capital and private equity firms interested in
consumer products, and loans from banks, are expected to encourage more players to enter
this category in the forecast years, thus helping to expand overall sales for this category.

Growth of the organised market to benefit sweet biscuits, snack bars
and fruit snacks
Considering the need for hygienic and quality controlled products in India, sweet biscuits,
snack bars and fruit snacks, which was initially fragmented in India, is becoming increasingly
organised. As a pre-emptive measure to avoid illness, consumers are increasingly ready to pay
a premium for packaged products. This trend is expected to continue in the forecast years, thus
contributing to growth.
