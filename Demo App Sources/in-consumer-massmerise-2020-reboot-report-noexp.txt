The COVID-19 pandemic continues to
affect the Indian economy across sectors,
including FMCG and retail. These sectors
have been facing massive disruptions
over the past few months across the
value chain, ranging from manufacturing
and logistics, to distribution and retail.
We have also seen drastic changes in
consumers’ behaviour during and after
the lockdown as they have continued to
study and work from home. As brands
adapt to the ‘new normal’, they have
to move to an agile business model to
minimise disruptions in the future as this
may not be the last pandemic. Companies
have to learn to proactively respond to
the new shopping habits that consumers
are developing in a continually changing
landscape. Brands and retailers will
need to re-learn the shopper journey
for their categories, to create seamless
shopping and consumer experience for
their customers. They also need to look
at putting consumers/shoppers in the
centre of everything they do.

The Deloitte−FICCI report “FMCG and
retail REBOOT” is developed against
this backdrop. The report looks at
how FMCG and retail companies must
REBOOT their business models as Indian
consumer/shopper journey evolves in
these changing times. In this paper, we
talk about the importance of how the
brands need to realign their businesses
and business priorities to enhance
consumer and shopper experience
by building a flexible distribution
network, accelerating the adoption
of omni-channel across brands,
continuously improving the supply chain,
and focusing on sustainable business
practices to operate efficiently and
thrive in a new business landscape.
In the ‘new normal’, brands need to be
highly adaptive to cater to these changes.
They need to be on top of new trends
and best practices in India and across the
globe, and alter their strategies quickly to
meet consumers’/shoppers’ expectations.

Foreword FICCI

FICCI

India has emerged as one of the most
attractive investment destinations
with the increasing disposable income,
rapid industrialisation, and a shift in
the demographic pattern. Amongst the
significant contributors to this growth
story have been the consumer-centric
sectors, such as retail, FMCG, and
e-commerce. India is one of the world’s
fastest-growing major economies and
has immense potential. However, there is
a need to further promote participation
and involvement of businesses for
furthering the cause of nation-building,
and achieving the societal goals of
inclusive growth and empowerment of
the people.
The COVID-19 outbreak is having a
severe impact on people, economy,
and business. The industry has shown
tremendous commitment to work with
the government and other agencies to
contain the spread of the virus. As the

06

country unlocks itself and opens up,
new trends and business practices are
expected to emerge. In view of this, the
theme for Massmerize 2020 is REBOOT.
FICCI Massmerize provides a perfect
platform to initiate a dialogue between
the government and the retail, FMCG,
and e-commerce sectors on various
regulatory issues and consumer trends.
The FICCI−Deloitte report that has the
underlying theme of ‘‘REBOOT’’ is an
attempt to analyse trends in the FMCG,
retail, and e-commerce industries in the
backdrop of the COVID-19 blow.
We hope that the insights shared
in this report will help identify new
opportunities and in turn, improve
performance across these sectors. At the
end of the day when businesses succeed,
the economy prospers and larger value
creation takes place, which ensures a
better future.

The Deloitte-FICCI thought leadership
report FMCG and retail REBOOT for
Massmerize’20 looks at ‘re-starting’
businesses as COVID-19 related lockdowns
have eased. It looks at new trends and
business practices emerging in the “new
normal”, and changes in consumer/
shopper behaviour in India. The report
is the fourth in a series of Deloitte-FICCI
reports released annually, following
KONNECTED to Consumers in 2017,
Consumer LEADS in 2018, and EVOLVE for
consumer in 2019.
FMCG and retail REBOOT: The fourth
edition of the report, taking cues from
the other three editions, examines how
brands need to ‘reboot’ their business
models and partnerships to thrive in
the new normal. In many cases, they
may consider abandoning age-old
route-to-market models and marketing
practices. As companies continue to
adapt to this prolonged and unplanned
lockdowns, their ability to rapidly digitise
the value chain, form alliances for
manufacturing, distribution, marketing

and product development, use data
analytics to understand consumers
and shoppers better to maintain and
possibly improve customer experience,
will be the big differentiator in the
industry. The lockdown has also given
most companies a chance to review
their operations, including their supply
chain and sourcing models, and invest
in cloud-based technologies, AI-enabled
digital procurement, AR and VR, block
chain, etc., to create demand-responsive
supply chains to cope with and predict
future disruptions. COVID-19 is a reminder
to the consumer industry about the
fragility in ways of doing business and
building models that can adapt rapidly.
As consumers and brands continue to be
more “KONNECTED” through technology
and the internet/e-commerce ecosystem,
brands must realise that the consumer
today LEADS the conversation (moving
from B2C to C2B) even more. They need to
cater to consumers’ needs in their product
and service offerings. As a result, brands
must EVOLVE and REBOOT their business
models to succeed.

R

Companies are re-evaluating their priority segments, distribution, and product mix, investing in more
agile planning solutions and exploring digitalisation. They are also re-assessing their manufacturing
footprint, etc., with a focus on catering to Indian consumers, while using raw materials sourced from
India and manufacturing in the country (under the government’s “Atmanirbhar” programme).

E

Companies are adopting strategies and harnessing digital technologies to cater to elevated consumer
experience and developing a “single view” of the consumer. They are moving towards personalised
zero-touch journey across the physical and digital channels (we see the emergence of ‘phygital’ retail),
and predictive metrics using AI, ML, and other exponential technologies.

B
Companies are re-evaluating and re-building their operating and distribution models during the
lockdown using new-age distribution channels (such as e-commerce, omni-channel, direct-toconsumer, hyperlocal delivery, and aggregator models). There has been an increase in focus on
hyperlocal deliveries, regionalisation, and rural markets. Companies have been forging new strategic
alliances to expand distribution capabilities and enable last mile delivery, while also looking to expand
their direct coverage across rural India.

O
The current pandemic has accelerated the shift of consumers to online and low-touch shopping
experience, as they continue to avoid visiting physical retail stores. As a result, brands and retailers
are looking to integrate online and offline digital touchpoints to influence and enhance their shopping
experience through the following measures: increasing hyper-personalisation; offering multiple and
fast payment options; providing responsive customer support; and adopting innovative business
models to facilitate last mile reach.

O
The changing dynamics post lockdown requires flexibility and agility in business operations. As
organisations move to the recovery phase, in many cases, they are looking at next-generation
manufacturing (Manufacturing 4.0), digital procurement based on AI and ML, sourcing, and physical
network reorientation, to reach pre-COVID-19 volumes. They are also using partner alliances and
ecosystems to facilitate this.

T
The COVID-19 crisis has caused disturbance across sectors. It has put sustainability on the back burner
in many cases, as companies struggle to recover and stabilise their businesses. However, the spotlight
on sustainability is likely to return in light of this pandemic as more governments are likely to push for
stringent compliance to existing sustainability norms and establish new ones. This will put pressure on
businesses to increase their investment to incorporate sustainability across their business strategies.

FMCG and retail REBOOT

The COVID-19 pandemic, ‘a stampeding
event’ in the history, has fundamentally
changed the business world. It has led
to consumers living differently, buying
differently, and in many ways, thinking
differently about their priorities. Longterm trends have also been significantly
disrupted, and changes anticipated over
the next few years have occurred in the
space of weeks, having a profound impact
on many businesses. As a result, brands
are reshaping their businesses in realtime; they are unsure how permanent
some of these changes will be.

Each chapter of the report looks at major
trends during the lockdown from an Indian
perspective. The chapters further highlight
some best practices through case studies,
which look at implementation of these in
the new normal world post lockdown. We
believe that the content and information
provided in the report will be beneficial for
stakeholders in the consumer and retail
sectors—consumers, shoppers, industries,
the government, and the academia.

FMCG and retail REBOOT

EVOLVE for consumer
The third edition of the four-year
annual series of reports delved into
the major aspects of a consumer’s
shopping cycle where brands needed
to “EVOLVE” to thrive in an evolutionary
consumer landscape. Consumer markets
are evolving rapidly with the help of
technology in an environment where data
is the new oil. In such a highly competitive
scenario, the report highlighted that

companies could not afford to overlook
any aspect of the shopper journey and
lag behind in the competitive market.
Consumer experience has become more
crucial today, and brands must constantly
innovate to offer novel products and
services to cater to modern consumers’
evolving demands. The report covered
the following aspects:

Engage for better connect: Personalised advertisements, proximity marketing, leveraging modern technologies
such as AR, VR, AI, chatbots, etc., are means through which brands—both offline and online—can engage with
their consumers.

Voice of consumer to be paramount: Listening to the consumers’ opinions, suggestions, and feedback is equally
important for offering them the most suitable products based on their needs. Social media sites, company websites,
blogs, emails, phone calls and texts, in-store communications, and other physical and online touch points should be
used for this—brands must be omni-present across mediums to listen and act upon the consumers’ needs.
Organise retail channels and trade to provide seamless and integrated solution: The retail market in India has
evolved from a “Bricks-versus-Clicks” to “Bricks-and-Clicks” and is now moving towards an “Intermix”. In future, the
most sustainable way for the brands to cater to consumers’ needs is to play across the confluence of multiple retail
modes—traditional stores, modern brick-and-mortar stores, online channels, etc.,—to offer a seamless shopping
experience.
Loyalty to be built by going the extra mile: There is a need to redefine the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for
loyalty measurement. In an environment where the consumers have a plethora of options and brands to choose from,
benchmarking loyalty through traditional parameters becomes highly challenging and not reflective in true sense. The
brands must go the extra mile to ensure that all its consumers have a memorable experience irrespective of whether
any products are bought or not.
Vouch for commitment: Consumers now actively gauge a brand’s commitment to its values and promises. They have
become more conscious than before regarding the sustainability practices of brands and the impact of these practices
on the environment. Hence, there is a growing need for public institutions and brands to collaborate and collectively
ensure sustainable measures as a standard norm in their operational practices.
Enhance product and service offering: While brands must use technology to engage with consumers more, there
is also a need to enhance the shopping experience of the consumers through hyper-personalised offerings, bespoke
marketing and loyalty solutions, agile and lean business models, etc. Another major trend is need for the vernacular
content to cater to the consumers’ needs—many brands are now catering to the demands of both urban and nonconsumers by offering their services in non-English regional languages.

Consumer LEADS: The second
edition of the annual series of reports
puts consumers and their buying
experiences at the forefront. While
brands must remain connected to
consumers throughout their shopping

journey, listening to the consumer is
also important as he/she “LEADS” the
conversation (moving from B2C to C2B).
The report delved into key action items
for brands, demonstrated through best
practices and select case studies:

FMCG and retail REBOOT

KONNECTED to Consumer: This edition
of the report explored the connectedness
of consumers—the main aspect being
that the internet and technology are
driving the inter-connectedness of

12

consumers amongst themselves and
with the brands, and that it was critical
for brands to be “connected” to their
consumers/shoppers to win them. The
report covered the following areas:

K

Knowledge of consumer data and insights
“Big” data generated via digital/online and through technologies used by brands in myriad forms and ways to make the
consumer retail journey and experience better. The knowledge from this valuable consumer data will help brands in
customised targeting, personalised offerings, and to have a more “meaningful” dialogue with their consumers.

O

Omni-channel approach unlocking the prospects
The infusion of offline and online retail modes has led to the emergence of omnichannel retail, where the shoppers may
browse online and buy offline or vice versa. This has led to the shifting of major brands into both pure-play offline and
pure-play online mode or a mix of both.

N

National policies impelling business growth and benefitting consumers
Conducive policies have led to increased investments that not only help the country grow monetarily, but also assist in
building infrastructure, bringing modern technologies, creating substantial social and environmental impact, etc.

N

Novelty attracting the new-age shoppers
While affordability and convenience remain the most crucial factors to influence a consumer’s purchase decision, novelty
or uniqueness in the offering also drives the sales. Novel approach by the brands to offer benefits via digital means also
helps brands in connecting with their consumers and building loyalty.

E

Environment and social practices driving sustainability and influencing consumer behaviour
Sustainable practices can help brands to stand out and build brand trust. Preference to sustainable practices such as
sustainable sourcing, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, waste management, clean packaging, natural and healthy
food options, etc., is gaining traction.

C

Convenience bridging the gaps
The growing consumer needs are pushing companies to implement improvements to their last mile delivery to make it
easy for consumer and shoppers to access the products. This compelling need of convenience and wanting the product
“now” is giving rise to hyperlocal start-ups, which connect local buyers and stores to penetrate remote areas, etc.

T

Technology augmenting consumer experience
Factors such as improved digital infrastructure, greater use of smartphones, and increasing number of start-ups in
technology space is assisting in wider acceptance and greater implementation of modern technologies for commercial
retail, especially with the evolved general trade.

E

E-wallets scaling up the payment ecosystem and handiness
Greater degree of convenience, increasing internet penetration, greater smartphone usage and government support
have led to the exponential growth of Unified Payment Instruments (UPI), especially m-wallets.

D

Digital marketing as growth engine
Advantages such as cost-effectiveness, consumer engagement, and personalised offerings are expected to drive the rapid
growth of digital marketing in India. Going forward, native marketing—a completely non-intrusive ad format—will be used
in India to make the ad experience of the consumers completely natural and in flow with their retail journey.

Realign businesses and business
priorities post COVID-19
In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, business leaders can
learn critical lessons from studying other global upsets in the
modern history.
01. Seismic events cause the tectonic
plates to shift and create entirely
new landscapes — the world
order, societal norms, and industry
structures will never be the same. A
“new normal” will emerge.”

and have the foresight to guide their
organisations through the storm and
position their companies to recover
and thrive. Leadership will be
shaped.
Indian consumers have been reported as
most anxious compared with their global
peers. However, with the total number of
COVID-19 cases coming down in the past
weeks, a sharp reduction is seen in the
anxiety levels.

02. Disruptive market conditions—
when the steady pace of
competition is replaced by volatility
and uncertainty—create ideal
opportunities for competitive
breakaway. This has the lasting
power of separating good from great.
Winners and losers will be made.

Indian consumers’ key concerns are around
health, safety, and financial stability. They
are still apprehensive with the proposition
of going to a public place, such as malls,
restaurants, or staying in a hotel.

03. Despite the critical importance of
responding swiftly to the crisis, some
of the most successful business
leaders look well beyond the clouds

The impact of the pandemic has been unprecedented. There continues to be great
uncertainty regarding the duration and depth of the crisis. Stay-at-home mandates,
and the resulting health and economic consequences are changing what we buy and
consume as well as where and how we shop.

16

FMCG and retail REBOOT

There are several fairly predictable outcomes on what we buy and consume. Various FMCG companies have already tried to respond to
the changing trends in an agile manner.

1.

Trend

Case Studies

Acceleration in e-commerce sales with consumers preferring
to stay at home; significant purchases were driven through
e-commerce.

• A company in the oral care space launched its made
for e-commerce range across product categories and
witnessed strong growth.
• A consumer company focused on Ayurveda and natural
products partnered with a food delivery player to deliver
products to consumers and used e-commerce for new
launches.

2.

Growth of the value segment – The financial uncertainty and
families eating together due to lockdown, led to both SKU
down trading in rural India at one end and family pack sizes
in urban India on the other end. However, bulk packs are on
a decline because of fewer institutional buyers.

• A large conglomerate has launched a hand sanitiser at a
price of half a rupee.
• A large consumer company saw ~50 percent of the general
trade business coming from lower-price and access points.
• In the potato chips category, a player saw larger pack sizes
of snacks moving faster off the shelves.
• A biscuits player saw the sales of Glucose biscuits bounce
back in the pandemic.

3.

Increased demand from Rural – COVID-19 has affected
about 40 million internal migrants, with 50-60,0001 moving
to rural areas in a span of days. With reverse migration and
increased MGNREGA spend, rural demand has picked up
favouring companies with strong rural distribution.

• A consumer company focused on Ayurveda is investing to
expand its rural coverage. It expects to connect with 60,000
villages by the end of this fiscal year.

4.

Focus on health, hygiene, and nutrition – Health concerns
and the need to build immunity have led consumers to
buy home sanitation and immunity boosting products; this
category saw drastic growth between March 2020 and May
2020.

• Several brands launched sanitisers and hand wash
products. Players focused on Ayurveda had more than 50
launches and those in a broader consumer category had 45
launches.
• An oral care player doubled down on its Ayurveda brand of
toothpaste and mouth spray.
• A large FMCG player launched 50+ new product/pack
innovations during the pandemic largely focused on the
health/hygiene/nutrition segments.
• An FMCG player from South India launched a range of
surface disinfectant sprays and partnered with a cab
service provider (for drivers) and a bank (for customers and
employees) for product activations.

World bank-COVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens
17

FMCG and retail REBOOT

With changing consumer preferences and operational
constraints due to the pandemic, FMCG companies are being
forced to make some hard choices on the business priorities.
01. Save to thrive
Based on a recent global study by Deloitte2,
expectation for positive revenue growth
has declined significantly due to COVID-19.
Compared with pre-COVID-19 expectations,
the percentage of respondents globally
expecting positive revenue growth is down
40 points. In India, the outlook is down by
20 points.
In India, 73 percent of the companies
surveyed expect to undertake a cost
reduction programme in the next 12
months. They are concerned with their
current cost structure. Companies have cut
down on their discretionary spending,
Due to COVID-19, companies optimised on
their trade spend, with focus on ensuring
product availability in the channel (as
consumers stocked up) and reduction in
advertisement budget across major players.
Reduction in advertisements, specifically
television advertisements, saw various B2C
start-ups take up top advertisement spots.
02. Re-evaluating priority segments
and products
With the reverse migration of labour and
increased spend by the government in
MGNREGA, the rural demand is expected
to be stronger. Consumers continue to
hold back on discretionary spending to
save cash. Per a recent report by Nielsen3,
increased focus on Middle and Rural India
was reiterated as the majority of CXOs claim
that they are increasing focus on Middle
India and rural markets over the next six
months. Contribution of lower town classes
to overall e-commerce has increased from
May to August vis-a-vis pre-COVID-19 levels.
There are visible signs of consumers either
downgrading to more affordable (mass and
popular) offerings or shifting towards
value-for-money large packs. Companies
have been forced to re-evaluate their
distribution and product mix in line with the
changing trends. Per a recent Nielsen study3,
2
3

36 percent CXOs plan to rationalise their
consumer offerings in the next six months.
03. Investments in digital
With social distancing norms in place
and uncertainty to general business,
larger players have also invested in digital
technologies to reduce cost structure and
increase business continuity. Companies
are extending partnerships with multiple
digitally native players to expand reach with
digitally native customers. A large FMCG
player is participating in the digitalisation
journey for general trade (GT) – an app for
its GT stakeholders now has 0.23 million
outlets onboard and seen a 2x rise in
order value and number of SKUs ordered.
Companies have also invested in more agile
planning solutions and explored digital
in manufacturing to enable continuity to
business and respond better to the crisis.
04. Re-evaluating supply chain
Closure of international borders for a
considerable time affected raw material
sourcing, creating supply chain shocks.
Several brands started vocalising about
their Indian roots calling for “vocal for
local”, influencing several consumers to buy
products that use raw materials sourced
from and manufactured in India. The trends
have led companies to re-evaluate their
manufacturing footprint for resilience
to manage such shocks and changing
consumer sentiments in the future.
With the continued uncertainty caused by the
pandemic and pressure on costs, companies
will have to realign their ‘where to play’
choices across geography, customers, and
products to maximise their returns and make
strategic business choices to ensure long-term
sustainability of the business. To win, companies
will have to ‘enhance’ consumer experience,
‘build’ resilient distribution, enhance their ‘omni’
channel play, ‘operate’ efficiently, and ‘thrive’ by
focusing on agility and sustainability.

Enhance consumer and
shopper experience
Customer experience has been a critical
pillar in the growth and transformation
strategy of retail and consumer companies
for over a decade. However, today’s
consumers are raising the bar for what
they expect along the shopping journey.
Further, past few months brought
fundamental shifts in the age-old habits
of Indian consumers – the way they buy,
consume, or engage with brands. These
shifts might be more enduring than
expected as consumers prefer remaining
cautious in the backdrop of uncertainty
caused by COVID-19.
In response to the current and expected
future consumer behaviour, companies
are adopting strategies to deliver an

enhanced and elevated experience.
We are witnessing rapid and full-scale
investments in new technologies to
improve access, increase personalisation,
and simplify interactions. It is crucial
to note that consumer experience (CX)
goes beyond traditional parlance of the
support and service function. Customer
experience is an outcome of every
form of engagement covering product,
brand, sales, relationship management,
transaction servicing, and others. Hence,
to be able to elevate customer experience,
companies need to complement their
technology investments with in-depth
understanding of their customers’ needs,
behaviour, and patterns.

Customers in India and their expectations from
consumer brands
Before delving into various kinds of experience strategies that companies can design
for their customers, let us understand Indian customers and their expectations from
consumer brands:

Pillars enabling companies to build an
experience strategy
The following four pillars can enable
companies to build an experience strategy
aligned with business objectives and
customer needs:
01. Safety and convenience
• COVID-19 has changed consumer
expectations. The lockdown led
rapid transition to online shopping.
However, health and safety
concerns are keeping customers
away from physical stores even
post lockdown. Consumers are in a
constant flux of two opposing forces
− concerns over visiting enclosed
spaces (such as retail stores or
malls), and at same time desire to
move out and interact with one
another.
• Catering to both these concerns
and desires in the most frictionless
manner possible, is crucial for
brands. We have seen most retail
stores deploying safety measures.
However, most of these measures
were inconvenient to follow or did
not cater to the scale of footfalls

in the shop. This led to customers
turning away or coming out
with frustrated experiences and
heightened concerns about their
health. Some of these measures
could include the following:
– Complement safety measures
with right convenience measures
enabled by technology − Selfservice checkouts, click and collect
models, curb-side delivery, queue
less aisles, and others
– Make behind-the-scenes action
visible − Humans look for tangible,
conspicuous signifiers that ensure
safety; signs that they can see,
feel, hear, and smell; awareness
campaigns on measures being
taken; frontline staff with uniform
and badges/certification tags; and
visibility on actions being taken
– Build a proof of capacity to
ensure social distancing − Queue
counter displays, waiting time,
appointment-based bookings, and
other such measures)

Case in point
• Leading food delivery apps created visibility about safety measures by providing
details such as name and temperature of stakeholders whose hands were passing
the parcel – the chef cooking the meals, the packing counter boy, and the delivery
boy carrying the meal. In addition, these apps adopted other measures, including
the following:
– Grading of participating joints based on safety and hygiene
– Video blogs on food safety and hygiene, including measures taken such as
touchless delivery
• Leading private airport provider, re-engineered end-to-end traveller journey by
keeping principles of hygiene at core; it further adopted a visible multi-channel
communication and awareness strategy to generate confidence in travellers on the
measures being taken.

02. Re-imagine channels where ‘old
and new’ can complement and
co-exist
Today’s customers are not only
digital savvy but fast becoming
digital natives, leading to a need for a
consolidated approach to customer
experience aligned with product
design and digital strategy. They
have become a king enabled through
several communication and social
media channels. Multiple channels
increase options for customers, and
the ability to demand customised
products and information. Customers
are more aware of competitive and
key service offerings across the
board.

by technological innovation at every
turn. They also use digital tools to
maximise productivity and efficiency,
and create a dynamic, engaging
experience.
Retail stores from physical to
phygital stores
Reconsider the size and number
of stores that will meet customers’
needs, eliminating poorer-performing
stores and focusing on flagship,
showrooms, and pop-up store
experiences. Consumers will no
longer come in just to browse; they
will arrive already knowing what they
want, and the associate’s role will be
to facilitate the purchase through an
exceptional customer experience.

Consumer and retail companies
need to take a page from digital-first
companies— it has never been more
important to build a seamless omnichannel brand presence. Customers
are looking for a digitised experience
(both online and offline), enabled

Cloud and AI-driven call centres
Contact centres are a key touchpoint
where businesses can build strong
connections, earn trust, and create
loyalty. Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains a
strategic priority for contact centres. Per
the Global Contact Center Survey 20194
by Deloitte, 75 percent contact centre
leaders invested in AI capabilities and 56
percent of them believed that AI has broad
applications in call centre transformation.
This was further accentuated in recent
times where anytime, anywhere call
centres became a reality. Service
continuity and sales pressure forced
companies to move from on-premise call
centres to remote call centres. Immediate
benefits realised from remote call centres
usually outweighed the challenges faced,
such as real estate savings, work-life
balance, and higher workforce diversity.
There is a growing acknowledgement that
issues faced were not flaws of operating
model design but attributable to timing
of events. Hence, there is greater support
for shifting to the ‘new normal’ in the
customer community.
As a result, many leading telecom
operators, banks, and retail giants are
considering adopting this as a norm.
As customers are also gearing to the
new normal in many facets of life, this
is the right time for organisations to
accelerate transformation of call centres.
Organisations can adopt three kinds of
AI-led service philosophies:
High touch-AI/cognitive levers used for
deflection to self-care; diagnosis to closure
via human intervention

4

Lite touch-Low complexity managed via
AI/cognitive; human intervention-based
diagnosis and resolution for higher
complexity issues
Zero touch-E2E interaction managed
via AI and cognitive for most call drivers;
human intervention only for exception and
premium handling
Conversational AI
Conversational AI refers to the use
of messaging apps, speech-based
assistants, and chatbots to automate
communication and create personalised
customer experiences at scale. Most
chatbots are used for deflection, i.e.,
channeling customers to the right queues.
AI is now changing this. Corporates are
investing significantly in conversational
AI to understand the intent and offer
first-point resolution to customers. This
will enable them to improve operational
efficiencies and elevate experience. Per
the Global Contact Center Survey 2019 by
Deloitte, use of chatbots and messaging
is expected to double for complex
interactions management in the next two
years. To get competitive advantage from
conversational AI, companies should focus
on the following:
• Integrate conversational capabilities
with intelligent automation to enable
extreme personalisation.
• Use conversational AI platform focused
on sales and collection along with
support services (this will make the
channel self-funding).
• Deploy conversational AI not just for
end customers, but also for managing
workforce and channel partner
experience.

Digital properties – Apps and social
media
Digital properties remain a crucial channel
in the experience value chain. However,
companies need to focus on the following
elements to ensure adoption at scale
across customer segments:
• Availability of digital properties in
vernacular languages with easy-to-use
visual interface

• Education and adoption measures,
including trust building activities for
more customers to sign up and transact
on digital properties
• Multi-channel linkage and real-time
information updates on digital
properties
• Linkage of digital experience with
physical channels

Re-imagined channels-Case in point
• A global Fortune 500 company had to make an emergency shift to work from
home call centre set-up, coupled with increased call volumes as physical channels
were not available due to the lockdown. The company worked by making the
shift from High Touch to Lite Touch call centre by strengthening IVR and bots, and
empowering customers with self-validation controls.
• Various B2C companies are running pilots to make digital properties available in
vernacular languages. One of the use cases is on vernacular bots. Although these
are in the nascent stage in India (due to 100+ dialects and language complexity),
this channel has the maximum potential given a low smartphone penetration and
literacy rates beyond urban India. Companies are exploring setting up voice bot
capabilities in local languages for sales and service journeys.
• Leading FS organisations are enriching conversational AI with ‘extreme
personalisation’ using advanced AI/ML and intelligent automation. These measures
will enable conversational AI to work as virtual voice agents for collection and
recovery use cases. As a result, the system is able to determine what time to call
which category of customers and how to adjust tone and wordings on the same
script to have effective collection rates. Given the success on collection rates, the
company is exploring deployment of extreme personalisation-led conversational
AI in B2B virtual sales management.
• A hyper market chain reformatted its store guidelines to sustain trust. These
guidelines include allowing a number of people at a time and rationing units of
purchase to avoid hoarding. It made the queue and crowd density information
visible on digital properties (such as app or web). This helped customers plan when
they could come. Further, they allowed customers to book slots when to visit (just
like dining reservations), equipping them with information to serve customers
better.
• Various luxury brands launched their season sales over virtual pop-up stores on
social media platforms and registered double-digit growth in sales and customer
engagements compared with the past year.

03. Customer experience strengthened
on pillars of workforce and partner
experience
Years of sub-optimal returns on
transformation projects, along with
COVID-19-driven shifts in human
behaviour and business challenges,
have revealed that silo focus on
customer experience capabilities
will not be enough to thrive into
the future. Instead, exponentially
growing results and flipping out of

the current mode would start when
organisations align and connect
customer experiences with workforce
and partner experience. Focusing on
partners and workforce responsible
for engaging and fulfilling customer
needs (customer experience elevation
requires an equal focus on partner and
workforce experience), is crucial.
A few interventions/use cases are
mentioned below:

Customer experience

• Empathy-focused new code of conduct and values
• Re-profile and redeploy staff with higher
vulnerabilities (e.g., expecting ladies in frontline)
• Changes in expected behavioural attributes
• Communicate job security and stability
• Re-iteration unending support
• Flatten listening hierarchies and provide more

• Fit-for-person motivation drivers
• Pre-emptive pulse on fatigue and the resilience
index
• Event-based sentiment check
• Skill refresh interventions, including soft skills
• Valued engagements through crowdsourcing/
innovation hackathons

04. Weaving experience as a true
differentiator
Using AI, ML, and other exponential
technologies, companies are replacing
conventional metrics of experience
with predictive metrics of behaviour
and real-time emotional sensing. This
helps companies with the following:
•

Segment customers based
on their values and subconscious behaviour for
sharper personalised offerings,
communication, and service

•

Sharpen existing segmentation by
a combination of behavioural data
with sales and operational data

•

Predictive understanding
of human behaviour and
expectations than reactive survey

Further, organisations are
complementing experience excellence
intent with equal competence across
the value chain. This includes designing
for new normal; preparing for ‘never
seen before’ rainy day scenarios; and
driving experience-linked business
outcomes on revenue acceleration,
cost, and efficiency savings.
Organisations must take a step back
and drive experience elevation focused
on three core elements – culture,
technology, and operations – using the
following underlying principles:
• Align culture, technology and data,
and operations towards a common

loyalty, trust, and confidence are being
put to test. Corporates and brands
must put customers’ interests first to
shine in these uncertain times. Those
that act quickly can capture loyalty via
human-centric transformations in the
next few months to build a legacy of
loyalty. As a leader, now is the time to

Building distribution
channels post COVID-19
Impact of COVID-19 on existing FMCG and retail distribution
The pandemic has forced many retail
stores and intermediaries to either
scale down or shut shop, causing
unprecedented disruption in retail
activity. Distribution channel partners
have suffered significant losses from
lockdown disruptions. In the retail and
FMCG segments, the pandemic has
affected critical areas, such as consumer
preferences/behaviour, fulfillment and
logistics, channel partner operations, and
workforce.
Changing consumer preferences:
COVID-19 pushed customers into
prioritising essentials and buying
more online
The pandemic has significantly altered
consumer preferences, purchase patterns,
and customer touchpoints. A recent
Deloitte consumer survey5 in the Indian
market revealed a growing trend towards
online shopping, preference for hyperlocal
deliveries, and blended commerce.
Consumers are giving importance to
safety and hygiene, thus avoiding visiting
physical marketplaces. Other trends being
observed are consumers’ willingness
to pay for convenience while cutting
down on discretionary spending due to
reduced income.
Fulfillment and logistics: During
the pandemic, movement of trucks
decreased to 95 percent from normal

maximum impact of the pandemic in
the initial days of the lockdown when
the movement of trucks decreased
significantly. The only movement witnessed
was that for essential goods. Intermittent
market lockdowns, and numerous security
and health checks significantly affected the
movement of raw materials and last-mile
delivery of products.
E-commerce players also had to suspend
their logistics services for sellers on their
platforms. According to the Retailers
Association of India (RAI), the supply chain
of about 25,000-30,000 supermarkets had
been affected.6

“Intermittent market lockdowns and numerous checks on
movement of goods led to the blocking of a number of pin
codes by logistics firms. There were rumours floating around
customers rejecting shipments in fear of contamination,
companies planning to fire staff owing to reducing orders,
etc., that added to the panic“
Representative of a logistics firm

As the country’s economy gradually
opened up and resumed normal
operations, logistics activities and players
witnessed a muted recovery due to
disruptions in market operations and
consumer sentiments.
Channel partner operations were
affected and resulted in lower cash
flows
Due to COVID-19 induced lockdowns,
many retailers and distributors saw a
sudden and dramatic halt in their cash
inflows as consumers stayed indoors
and reduced spend on non-discretionary
purchases. As retail stores remained shut,
distributors fearful of non-payment from
retailers (of consumer goods, electronics,

smartphones, etc.) and an increase in
lending strictness from banks and NBFCs,
started dealing only in cash instead of
continuing with the usual practice of
offering up to three weeks of credit. This
is because they feared defaults by small
retailers.
This adversely affected flow of goods. The
problem was more pronounced in smaller
towns where local kirana shops often
provide goods to regular customers on
credit. The pandemic pushed these buyers
(including migrant workers who returned
from cities) in smaller towns to default.
Slowing of credit rotation led to a reduced
return on investment across the retail
supply chain.

More than one crore migrant
workers7 moved back to their
hometowns during the pandemic
As companies struggled to create
and fulfill consumer demands, they
faced another challenge in the form of
reverse migration. Even when lockdown
restrictions were eased and companies
were allowed to resume operations, a
majority of their workforce had travelled
back. This has forced stores to operate at
reduced capacities. Distributors operating
with minimal staff were unable to supply
goods down the channel, forcing retailers
to arrange delivery of goods.

“We have stocks ready to be transported
in our godowns but are unable to find
people who can help us deliver them
to kirana outlets. The majority of the
loading, transportation, and unloading
activities were done by migrant
labourers from other states who are now
unavailable. Additionally, we are losing
customers as small retail shop owners
are shutting shops and moving back to
their hometowns.“

How companies are innovating and rebuilding
distribution systems post COVID-19
The pandemic revealed that companies
using digital channels, such as
e-commerce, omnichannel, and direct-toconsumer, were able to adapt and recover
faster. Companies that were ahead of the
curve in the digital transformation journey
proved to be best-equipped to manage

the repercussions and navigate the
pandemic with a relatively lesser impact.
Companies that relied only on traditional
distribution channels to service customers
were at a greater disadvantage. The major
trends that are emerging in rebuilding
distribution are the following:

omnichannel and market
aggregators

and regionalisation

FMCG and retail REBOOT

Increasing focus on hyperlocal and
regionalisation
The distribution trend that has gained
significant attention from business
leaders today is hyper localisation. In
the past, companies had experimented
with hyperlocal distribution to achieve
varying levels of success. However, a
supporting ecosystem of customers,
technology platforms, and last-mile
delivery players have been gradually
building up. Additionally, there has been
a growing acceptance of channel partners
during the pandemic. Distributors/dealers
are looking at it as another channel to
capture the market rather than treating
it as competition. The pandemic saw
a significant increase in the hyperlocal
delivery of essential items, such as
groceries, fruits, and hygiene. Consumers
who had been compelled to stay indoors
because of the fear of infection, quickly
transitioned to online marketplaces
offering delivery at doorsteps.
Another trend observed in case of
companies with global sourcing and
distribution systems was the prolonged
impact of disruptions on operations.
Companies and their channel partners
suffered from an acute shortage of
raw material/finished goods as the
sourcing countries went into lockdown.
This dependency and reliance on global
partners are compelling them to reevaluate their strategy of centralised
distribution and sourcing. The flexibility
offered by multi-level sourcing and
distribution channels is capturing leaders’
interest. The sourcing and distribution
channel is undergoing a significant change
and witnessing the re-emergence of
regional logistics hubs.
Case: Companies launching hyperlocal
platforms and delivery capabilities
One of India’s largest marketplaces has
piloted a hyperlocal delivery model to
deliver products across categories such
as grocery, mobiles, electronics, and
home accessories. The company provides

“The company witnessed 3-5x growth
in demand for hyperlocal delivery of

Demand for other non-essential product
categories is also increasing.“
Leading logistics player

consumers an option to fulfill orders in
90 minutes or book a 2-hour slot on the
basis of their preference. At present, the
company has tied up with 3PL for lastmile delivery. However, it plans to move
towards a hybrid model wherein they can
use local shop owners and their existing
logistics capability to deliver products.
Increasing use of digital technologies
to take orders remotely and enhance
fulfillment levels
The traditional model of flooding the
market with the inventory at channel
partners and stores is sub-optimal at
many levels. Sensing demand, forecasting
accurately, and building visibility in the
system are essential for companies to
extract maximum value from existing
infrastructure and assets. Building a
flexible and adaptive channel is now a key
requirement for sustaining a business.
The right combination of route to market,
digital solutions, and technology adoption
is crucial for building a responsive
distribution. Real-time visibility on
facilities, operations, and logistics will
play a key role in enabling the business to
make informed decisions. Companies use
new-age technologies, such as IoT, artificial
intelligence, sales automation tools, big
data, and analytics to enable visibility and
traceability, and build digitally connected
networks.

37

FMCG and retail REBOOT

Companies have witnessed a manifold
increase in the adoption of salesforce
automation tools, enabling teams to do
remote/telephonic selling. Remote selling
capabilities, coupled with demand visibility
and order fulfillment, have enabled
companies to effectively service outlets
with optimal inventories.
Case: Companies using analytics/tech
to build innovative fulfillment options
A leading apparel manufacturer has
undertaken a transformation journey to
enhance its sales operations and strategy
with the help of new-age digital solutions.
The company had implemented sales
automation tools for both the company
and channel/franchise partners to
enable greater visibility on operations
and enhance productivity. Data captured
from these tools are used to create
performance dashboards for leadership
to take proactive business decisions.
The company has witnessed a significant
improvement in the adoption of these
tools since the outbreak of the pandemic.
Encouraged by the improvements, the
company is investing in building remote
sales capabilities to enable business
continuity and ensure minimal impact
on sales.

of the total population and contributes
significantly to the overall FMCG spend.
Reverse migration, decreasing digital
divide, and increased government focus
and expenditure, are expected to expand
markets and increase demand in rural
areas. Further, recent government
reforms in the agri space are likely to
improve returns for farmers and improve
average household income/consumption.
Contribution from agriculture and allied
services is expected to fuel rural/Indian
economic growth, especially during
COVID-19.

Drivers of rural consumption and demand
include the following:
• Increase in purchasing power due
to growth in agricultural output and
the government’s focus on increasing
agricultural income and output
• Augmented government spending on
rural infrastructure development and
poverty elimination programmes
• Increased production in rural; the share
of rural industrial output as a percent of
the total industrial output, has doubled
in the past few years9
In light of increasing rural consumption,
companies are re-focusing their strategies
on reaching out to rural customers, and
investing in building and strengthening
their distribution capabilities in rural
markets. Traditionally, companies had
built indirect distribution capabilities to
serve rural markets. This led to limited
visibility on the flow of products and
consumer purchase patterns, and a
relatively higher cost to serve. With
increasing consumer demand, companies
now focus on building their direct
distribution to gain a stronger foothold in
the market and boost sales.
Case: Investment in expanding
distribution capabilities in rural
markets
A leading Indian conglomerate is
expanding its reach in rural markets by
investing in building warehousing and
distribution capabilities. The company
plans to use these warehouses in addition
to their brick and mortar outlets as lastmile connection points for its e-commerce
venture. The company also plans to
set up internet-enabled kiosks at these
points to allow rural consumers to place
online orders. Using these new innovative
connection centres, the company intends
to sell a wide range of products that
have a long shelf life and do not require
installation assistance. Additionally, these
centres can act as delivery/collections

centres. The company has plans to extend
this model to groceries, personal care
products, apparel, footwear, etc. After the
successful implementation of this project,
the company intends to have an effective
presence and direct access to ~95 percent
of the Indian population.
Strategic alliances to expand
distribution capabilities and reach
Building or expanding a business cannot
be successfully achieved solely on the back
of a great product/service and business
plan. Ensuring visibility and product
availability for the right set of customers at
the right time is an essential component.
Companies have explored numerous
distribution channels and configurations
to achieve this.
The pandemic, with market lockdowns,
compelled companies to re-configure
their distribution systems within a short
period. As customers were locked indoors,
companies had to explore omni-channel
and hyperlocal delivery models. New and
unconventional partnerships were forged
to achieve this feat.

FMCG companies partnered with
online marketplaces to showcase their
products on online marketplaces.
They also partnered directly with
third-party delivery services to enable
doorstep delivery. Fulfilment of these
orders were routed via a company’s
existing channel partners to support
the entire value chain.

Post the pandemic, we are witnessing a
seismic shift in how companies are reconfiguring and re-thinking distribution
strategies. More companies are exploring
alliances that can offer greater value
than a simple movement of goods
across locations. We are witnessing an

increasing trend, and need for companies
to enter into strategic and unconventional
partnerships to enhance visibility,
expand coverage, and penetration
while optimising cost to serve. These
new-age partnerships serve a varied
set of purposes related to capability
enhancement, logistical support, and
market and consumer insights.
Case: Enhancing reach and revamping
consumer shopping experience
A leading Indian conglomerate’s retail
arm partnered with a popular instant
messaging platform to deploy a
conversational commerce platform for
grocery orders. Customers can search
for a local business on the app, browse
through its catalogue, and complete
purchase either on the app itself or place
an order online and collect products from
the store. The partnership may later be
extended to include the distribution of
medicines, fashion, lifestyle products,
food, etc.
New-age distribution channels using
omni-channel and aggregator models
Rise of omni-channel models
With evolving consumer and market
trends, urbanisation, burgeoning
millennials, consumption-driven society,
brand awareness, and rising income,
companies have had to modify business
models and operations to cater to
these market disruptions. Knowledge of
consumer, micro-markets, demography,
real-time view of operations thus becomes
essential. Companies have progressed
from traditional distribution channels
servicing brick and mortar outlets to
e-commerce and further to multi-channel.
They are now gradually progressing
towards an omni-channel approach. Each
model has brought companies closer to
their customers.

The FMCG market had been growing with
an increasing share of e-commerce and
direct-to-customer models. The pandemic
further accelerated this trend. Digital
collaborative distribution models became
the need of the hour for companies to
connect and service customers offering
a convenient, hygienic, personalised,
and consistent offline-to-online (O2O)
experience.
The share of e-commerce and DTC
channels is rising, driven by the following:
• Increasing digital spend by millennials

10

40

• Growing need for personalisation and
customisation
• Rising preferences for convenience and
faster deliveries
• Growing in-home consumption
Digital native brands, the early adopters
of direct distribution channels, have
proven the potential of this channel. The
changing consumer and market trends are
now coercing traditional brands to enter
this space and build it as an additional
channel.

FMCG and retail REBOOT

Emergence of aggregator models for
distribution
This shift towards online channels can
be witnessed across the B2B space as
well. While some players have existed
for decades, the majority of the other
companies failed to make a mark. Recent
structural market changes in the form of
GST, rising internet penetration, growth
of digital payments, government and PE/
VC funding, and even demonetisation
are fostering the growth of these startups and aggregators. Start-ups such as
Udaan, Jumbotail, ShopX, and Ninjacart
have raised significant funding in the
past few years. Encouraged by this trend,
even the government has launched an
e-marketplace to improve procurement
efficiencies at public-sector enterprises.
These aggregators, primarily operating
in the B2B space, are re-defining the
distribution ecosystem by increasing
efficiencies, reducing prices, and rising
effective margins available to channel
partners. They offer a wide range of
services, including the following:
• Product visibility/discovery via an online
marketplace
• Platform for conducting commerce
activities
• Finance and credit facilities
• Logistics and last-mile delivery services
• Value-added services, such as analytics
and advertising

Retailers and enterprises are finding value
in these players as they provide direct
access to a wider range of customers,
along with transparency in operations.
In the B2B space, customers find value
in this model as they can easily compare
services across multiple players and get
guaranteed delivery. During the pandemic,
acceptance of online commerce has
improved in the retailer community, which
was a major challenge before the onset of
the pandemic.
Case: B2B e-commerce channel to
expand reach/coverage and offer
innovative business models
• A B2B start-up currently present in
Bengaluru is serving about 20,000
neighborhood kirana stores. The
company has created an ecosystem
wherein it offers the following services:
– Order fulfillment via their warehouses
– Last-mile and home delivery
– Supply services to local stores
– Credit and working capital support
• Another B2B e-commerce player
focusing primarily on rural markets
aims to act as a bridge between
rural consumers and manufacturer/
primary markets. The company offers
a wide range of services, including the
following:
– Direct to home delivery for consumers
– E-commerce tech platform for a retailer
to cater to their sourcing requirements
from the convenience of their shops
– Credit, marketing, analytics, and
logistics support to local retailers

Building future-proof distribution channels: Potential
interventions and critical success factors
Companies that learn from market
disruptions and put customers at the
heart of their operations (i.e., transform
their mindset and enable channel partners
to progress from simply catering to
consumer requirements to identifying
the latent need, shaping requirements,

and proactively delivering solutions) are
more likely to succeed in future-proofing
their businesses. Companies are exploring
digital and sales interventions across the
channel that will help them extract greater
value and build sustainable distribution
channels.

To build future-proof distribution with the help of channel partners, the focus should be
on the following key elements-Engage, Innovate, and Empower

and market insights

A

B

Engage: Distribution has always
been a customer-centric business
with interactions playing a key role.
With the rise of new distribution
trends and channels, this aspect
has been further amplified with
distribution channels to engage in
more effective communications
across the value chain and with
customers. Easy access to data
and information have empowered
customers and stakeholders across
the value chain to become more
informed and require engagement
across various touchpoints (online
and offline).

Innovate: Distribution channels
need to use insights through
data and process improvements
to extract exponential value
from existing infrastructure
and assets. Companies need to
work with channel partners to
optimise key components, such
as pricing, SKU management,
inventory management, and
network optimisation, to transform
operations, optimise cost to serve,
and enhance efficiencies within the
value chain. Managing trade-off
between service and stock levels,
product assortment carried, and
re-imagining channel configuration
can drive greater value from existing
assets, and enable companies
to invest in building innovative
customer servicing and fulfillment
strategies. This will help bring in
agility and improve receptiveness to
pilot and experiment with innovative
strategies to develop micro-market
specific distribution strategies.

Distribution channels and partners
can no longer survive by overflowing
the market with inventory, sales
representatives, and branch offices.
To build a sustainable and preferred
route to market, channels/channel
partners need to capture a wide
range of data points and collaborate
with partners to derive insights and
new applications. Companies need
to build a holistic offering package
for their channel partners, and drive
productivity and effectiveness.

• Empower channel partners
with digital technologies
• Micro-market segmentation
and strategy
• Leverage digital and
analytics to mine insights

C
Empower: To empower channel
partners, companies will need
to leverage digital and new-age
technologies, embrace data, and
generate insights from them.
Technology implementations have
transitioned from being a mere
change of systems to transformation
drivers that help re-imagine
business with new streamlined
processes and automated functions.
Companies can build a single
view of customers, markets, and
operations, resulting in a deeper
market understanding for micromarket segmentation and designing
specific distribution strategies.
Additionally, an empowered
channel facilitates the capturing
of valuable data across customer
touchpoints, thereby enabling a
superior customer experience and
transformed operations.

Omni-channel for expanding reach
Omni-channel is being fuelled by increased digital
influence, demand for differentiated experience, and
tailored experiences for and orientation of consumers.
The proliferation of digital touchpoints has transformed consumer behaviour. Customers
want same service levels and access to information throughout their purchase journey
regardless of interaction channel (physical store, mobile device, or website). In addition,
tailored and engaging experiences and an emotional connect are strong drivers for
choosing a brand.

Changing consumer preferences are driving omni-channel adoption

Anytime anywhere access
Consumers want to have a twoway conversation and access
brands across channels.
Personalisation
Consumers are looking for options
that are tailored to their needs and
customised to their preferences.
Emotional connect
Consumers want to discover
unique brands with mission
statements that they align with.
Differentiated experience
Consumers are drawn to engaging
and relevant experiences that turn
them from a passive recipient to
an active shopper.

In response, retailers use a combination
of online and offline digital touchpoints
to influence and delight consumers. This
has become especially important in the
current pandemic, which has accelerated
the shift of consumers to an online and
low-touch delivery experience. While
consumers have become accustomed
to online shopping during the current
lockdown, a need for ‘real-world’
experiences that physical stores offer will
always exist. To meet this need, retailers

are looking to seamlessly integrate
channels and extend offline experiences
to include online platforms.
Hence, omni-channel is the retail model
of the future with a shift in focus from the
company to the customer. In addition, by
adopting this model, retailers can increase
footfall in stores, improve conversions,
and offer a better experience to customers
than competition.
45

FMCG and retail REBOOT

COVID-19 has accelerated omni-channel strategy formulation
To future-proof their business, retailers had already embarked on an omni-channel
journey. The pandemic has accelerated this shift. This scenario also demonstrated that
retailers who were either prepared for or had completed this transformation before the
pandemic struck have been able to weather the storm better.
Case study
After implementing effective omni-channel strategies, an American retail
corporation witnessed a 141 percent increase in digital sales despite the majority of
its stores having remained open. This contributed to a same-store sales growth of
10.8 percent. The retailer also acquired 5 million new customers. In April, sales on
curb-side pickup increased nearly 1,000 percent. The same-day delivery option via
multiple fulfilment options also was popular with a growth of 278 percent.
Case study
One of the top retail jewellers in India introduced gold ownership certificates to
enable customers to make continued purchases during the lockdown. Multiple
lockdown-related campaigns were also launched to capture the consumer mind
space. The store landscape was modified to ensure social distancing, and enable
appointment and occasion-based purchases. Convenient payment options were
enabled through e-gift cards

Technology-driven hyperpersonalisation
Businesses use tools and technologies
such as CRM and IoT-enabled devices to
gather data of a customer’s interaction
with the brand across multiple
touchpoints. This allows them to offer
customised experiences using AI,
augmented reality/virtual reality, etc., in
the physical and digital environments.
Multiple payment options
Launch of new technologies and growth of
fintech have led to convenient and faster
checkout processes. Contactless payment
is also gaining steam because of the
pandemic.
Customers are now embracing digital
payment options, such as QR code
enabled transactions, mobile wallets, NFC,
and UPI. According to NPCI data, volume
of UPI transactions almost doubled
between Sept 2019 and Sept 2020.12
Responsive customer support
In 2018, brands in the US lost US$75

billion of business as customers switched
brands because of bad customer service.13
Customers want immediate help and
support during their purchase journeys.
Businesses are setting up integrated
contact centres to provide anytime and
anywhere customer support through
phone calls, social media, email, text,
video, and live chat.
Innovative business models
As working from home has become the
new normal, businesses are using digital
interventions, such as remote selling/
video calling to connect with consumers.
This will also help re-evaluate priority
customers and cater to the shift in focus
from urban to rural on account of rapid
reverse migration.
Remote selling consists of an end-toend sales cycle starting from creating
awareness to providing after sales service.
Given the pandemic, brands are expected
to continue to explore this option to
provide better customer experience and
augment sales.

Operate more efficiently
Impact of COVID-19
Orchestrating the recovery to the pre-COVID-19 levels would require significant
collaboration and coordination within and across organisations as new operating models,
partnerships, and national policies continue to evolve. Absence of a precedent and the
simultaneous impact across nations are adding to the complexity as serial learnings
cannot be applied. Hence, there are no proven playbooks to date. In such situations,
three timeframes over which a crisis plays out are mentioned below:
Prepare and
manage continuity

Respond – During which organisations are focused on dealing with the present situation
to ensure survival, continuity, and safety
Recover – During which organisations use their learnings from the Respond phase and
emerge stronger and become more competitive in the marketplace
Thrive – During which organisations shape the future of their businesses
Over the past seven months, the priority
of businesses and their leaders in India
has been responding effectively to the
dynamics of the marketplace except
in a few sectors (including food and
pharmaceuticals) where organisations
now focus to recover and thrive. However,
given the changing dynamics requiring
flexibility and nimbleness, organisations
across sectors need to consider three
timeframes concurrently and accordingly
allocate time, effort, and resources.
With the added dimension of Non-

Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), this
would require levels of orchestration
and coordination that have not been
attempted before over an extended period
of time given the current state of the
pandemic. The criticality emerges from the
fact that organisations’ decisions will have
a significant impact on their business and
operating models. Hence, these decisions
would be the foundation for the business
to thrive, and achieve sustained and
profitable growth and performance post
the pandemic era.

51

FMCG and retail REBOOT

Impact and implications on supply chains
of organisations
There are a number of significant supply
chain implications on businesses that
have been created/evolved from the way
the ecosystem has responded to the
pandemic.
Fatigue of intermediaries
In the recent past, supply chains have
been characterised by a significant
increase in “Go Direct to Customer”
models specifically in the consumer
business segment. In our estimates,
most leading organisations have moved
exponentially to about 15 percent of their
total sales being direct to consumer. This
is also being accelerated by customer
expectations that are now characterised
by “fatigue of intermediaries.”
Changing expectations require
organisations to provide a multitude of
fulfillment options to customers (e.g., ship
from store, pickup at store, same-day
delivery, and digital delivery). In the near
term, to add to the complexity, customers
would be able to choose and change the
fulfillment option while the product is in
transit.
Instant fulfillment orientation
In a significantly proliferated portfolio
that organisations are expected to carry
in India, they need to hold inventory to
meet demand from different channels
while catering to customer expectations
on both service levels and defined delivery
windows. This, coupled with the range
of fulfillment modalities, significantly
increases inventory in the channel/
working capital requirements and/or stock
outs for the business.
(Un) predictability of demand
With price in perspective, convenience
drives customers’ purchase decisions.
Hence, the shift in channels as they access
goods and services makes it difficult for
organisations to hardwire their supply
chain infrastructure and ecosystem.
Without real-time information and
predictive models, organisations may not
be in a position to forecast demand and
52

run the danger of duplicating demand
data across channels.
Bi-directional supply chains
With a proliferated portfolio, on-line
ordering and multiple variables to choose
from, expectation mismatches exist. This
creates significant pressure on supply
chains to configure a robust and visible
reverse supply chain that sustains the cost
structure of a business and addresses
complexity (as products could be returned
through a different channel than what was
considered for ordering).
Drag of technology
“Digital supply chains” is the buzzword
for businesses. However, with
uncertainty caused by the pandemic,
most organisations in India have to
make the decision of replacing their
ecosystem of aging, inefficient, and fragile
legacy systems that lack the flexibility,
responsiveness, and computing power to
appropriately orchestrate an India-wide
multi-node, multi-echelon, dynamic supply
chain. Furthermore, most systems are at
best point solutions or a range of solutions
which are not integrated. Hence, they
would not be able to provide end-to-end
visibility required to optimise and address
emerging dimensions.
Fragmented physical footprint
Many of today’s largest retailers have
grown through acquisition, resulting in a
network footprint which is far from any
theoretical optimal solution. Distribution
centre coverage may overlap; it is usually
not enough to justify capital required for
consolidation. Facilities of different eras
and leadership ambitions may challenge
efforts to standardise processes and
handling.

FMCG and retail REBOOT

Considerations for organisations
This is a unique moment for organisations
in which they can plan and execute
actions for tomorrow without a significant
baggage of the past. Seven key actions
that are expected to characterise
the successful journeys of leading
organisations are discussed below.
What to own in the supply chain – value
delivery or value addition?
With uncertainty in demand,
organisations are forced to do more
with less to preserve cash and enhance
competitiveness. This, coupled with
changing customer preferences and
expectations, is forcing organisations to
rethink their value proposition. Focus
is now on answering the fundamental
question of what in the supply chain
should the organisation own and what
should be leveraged from others. The

focus has now shifted from value addition
to value delivery that goes beyond
traditional outsourcing or contracting.
An example is the new ecosystem that
is being created in logistics where the
core organisation is at the periphery of
the ecosystem. Although the ecosystem
includes automotive OEMs, it has the
mindshare of the customer from an
experience viewpoint. This enables
organisations to focus on their core supply
chain competencies and capabilities that
would enhance customer experience
while using best practices for sustained
competitiveness.
This has significant ramifications including
the ones on the talent models. Tasks that
would require a full-time employee in an
office could now be farmed out to ‘gig
economy’ workers.

Operating model – a move to hyper
segmentation
The primary requirement from supply
chains is the alignment to the business
and customer strategies. As organisations
are fine-segmenting their market to
enhance customer experience, they also
need to segment their supply chain for a
synchronous planning and fulfillment of
customer requirements.
Class-leading companies have now
embarked on the journey of hyper
segmenting their portfolios to
plan, source, make, and deliver in a
heterogeneous model aligned to market
demands. This should be based on
fulfillment, service levels, and cost to
serve than a homogenous model that is
unidimensional for most markets and
segments. The collateral impact of this
is the reduction in complexity for the
business and therefore, the enhanced
focus of the leadership on exceptions in
the value chain.
Comprehensive digital acceleration
Most digital interventions are planned as
a set of un-coordinated point solutions
with the primary purpose of rapidly
digitising old processes and operating
models for functional effectiveness. While

sensors that measure critical inputs from
the physical process and its surroundings

54

these provide instant gratification to both
leaders and executives involved in the
programmes, their impact on business
competitiveness even in the short term is
questionable.
Leading organisations are taking the
alternate route of working on a broader
organisation platform that includes their
extended supply chain to create and
deploy solutions that help solve data and
digital problems across the extended
enterprise. The outcome is a “Digital
Twin,” which is an evolving digital profile
of the historical and current behaviour
of a physical object or process that helps
optimise business performance (based on
massive, cumulative, real-time, real-world
data measurements across an array of
dimensions).
This would be the building block for an
integrated capability connecting internal
and external supply chain systems with
relevant customer insights pulled in
from various nodes of the supply chain
– consumption, patterns, velocity, time
windows, etc. This data-rich network helps
generate real-time customer insights
from a supply chain perspective, enabling
appropriate decision-making to minimise
lost sales and customers.

FMCG and retail REBOOT

Physical network reorientationInfrastructure for flexibility and rapid
response
Companies need to use the opportunity
presented by changing customer
preferences on fulfillment to replace
or optimise legacy supply chain
infrastructure, including physical
distribution sites and delivery capabilities,
to prepare for a more transparent and
flexible supply chain. This would mean
not just consolidation and aggregation
of the footprint but a significant move
towards optimising space, enhancing
quality of infrastructure, and filtering the
associated partners. An optimisation rate
of 20 percent in the legacy footprint is
envisaged.

In summary
As executives and businesses make
the decisions required to ensure their
organisations’ recovery, supply chain
functions are getting closer to the
decision-making process and providing
insights required to drive strategy. First
is a specific focus on the dimensions of
scenario planning that help business
understand both the short-and mediumterm implications. The second has
been the impact on improved capital
performance enabled by digitalisation of
the supply chain to provide actionable
recommendations.

Leverage partner alliances and
ecosystems
One of the key disruptions has been the
emergence of start-up ecosystems that
can provide competitive advantages
through best-in-class solutions. As
organisations make decisions on these,
key factors for consideration should not
be limited to traditional models of cost
of ownership but focus on differentiating
elements, including acquisition and
retaining of talent, and technological
flexibility to tackle both the problems of
today and the decade. These decisions will
affect competitiveness, speed-to-market,
and general business agility.

Thrive by focusing on
sustainability
Sustainability has become a buzzword in
the spheres of innovation and marketing
over the past few years. With disruptions
in the environment due to natural and
man-made disasters, sustainability has
also gained prominence in boardroom
discussions. Besides climate change, the
three key factors that put sustainability
at the top of organisational agendas, are
discussed below.

Changing consumer
habits
As businesses seek to become more
responsible corporate citizens, consumers
too are now acknowledging the need to
reduce carbon footprint.
A recent survey found that more than
43 percent consumers are choosing
brands based on brands’ environmental
values. About 34 percent consumers’
buying behaviour is based on a brand’s
ethical credentials, and two-thirds of
the consumers surveyed indicated
a significant reduction in the use of
single-use plastics.14
A demographic study revealed that people
over 45 years are most likely to reduce their
consumption of single-use plastic. They are
also keen to engage in other environmental
issues, such as cutting carbon emissions.
While those aged 18-34 are most likely to
choose brands for their ethical values. People
of all ages are adopting more sustainable
consumer behaviours.14 With this in mind,
brands are proactively looking to build
sustainable practices across their supply
chain.

14

Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 crisis has also put
sustainability in the spotlight. Businesses
are looking at reorganising their supply
chain to build operational resilience and
incorporate sustainability across strategies.
It often takes a great deal of upheaval
and strife to cause a fundamental
societal change. COVID-19 is seen to be
providing that uncomfortable upheaval
across sectors right now. It is expected to
cause a fundamental shift in investment
and activity towards sustainability. The
question is how far will these changes go?
It is almost a certainty that there will be a
massive reassessment and realignment of
supply chains. It is also likely that investors
and consumers will factor sustainability
much more strongly while evaluating
opportunities.

Waste management rules
and Extended Producer’s
Responsibility (EPR) in the
Indian context
The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016
and the E-Waste (Management) Rules 2016
have become wider in their ambit, and
specifically refer to the EPR. Both these
rules have been adopted at a central level
and applied throughout India. Some states
have extended applicability beyond these
provisions and banned single-use plastic.

https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/sustainable-consumer.html
57

FMCG and retail REBOOT

The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016
impose obligations on “brand owners”,
“producers,” and “importers.” These rules
have introduced the notion of EPR in the
context of plastic waste management. For
the first time, the rules also cover “waste
generators” that include every individual
generating waste.
The e-waste rules contain specific e-waste
collection targets that producers must
achieve as part of their obligations as
members of the producer responsibility
organisation − starting with 10 percent of
the quantity of waste generated to going
up to 70 percent by 2023.

need to factor in while working on their
sustainability agenda are mentioned below:
• Every company is not on the same level
of maturity regarding sustainability,
making it difficult to have a standardised
benchmark for sustainability.
• Aligning sustainability with business
objectives across various geographies
and businesses is crucial.
• Lack of awareness and sophistication
amongst supplier networks (key
emission contributors) remains a barrier
in achieving sustainability targets.
• On-ground implementation still
remains an important challenge.

EPR is a means to enable large
corporations in India share the burden
of waste management, as is being
done in several countries. Over the
years, companies have been allocating
disproportionately higher funds towards
developing new plastic materials but
hardly anything for post-consumer
management. India’s uniform framework
on EPR offers a timebound effort and
provides for progressive intervention in
the future on part of corporations.

• Consumers may be seen as advocates
for change, but they are rarely activists
for change.

For corporation, EPR in India entails
economic responsibility (all or part
of the expenses for the collection,
recycling, or final disposal of products
they are manufacturing); physical
responsibility (physical management
of products); and informative
responsibility (information on the
environmental properties of products).

Looking around
Sustainability has become a watchword
for organisations and governments across
the world. Enterprises can look around to
understand and implement regulations
that stem from government initiatives to
become more sustainable. They can also
seek inspiration or use capabilities from
the business environment to respond to
these initiatives and use sustainability as a
driver for innovation.

Aligning green goals and meeting their EPR
responsibilities will help brands fulfil their
corporate social responsibility, and assist
them in building brand trust and gaining
allied competitive advantages.

Challenges in
accomplishing
sustainability agenda
While sustainability is the need of the
hour, some aspects that organisations

15

Sustainability has now reached a tipping
point where enterprises that embrace
it will reap potential benefits. Those
that do not adopt it may miss out on
relevant opportunities. Let us learn
how organisations can overcome these
challenges to accelerate their growth and
transformation by looking around, looking
inside, and looking ahead.

01. Global environment, COVID-19, and
the plastic ban
Research from the Pew Charitable
Trusts and SYSTEMIQ indicates that 11
million metric tonnes of plastic flowed
into oceans in 2016. This number
is projected to be 29 million metric
tonnes in 2040. The same research
found that 40 percent of today’s
global plastic waste ends up in the
environment, with single-use plastics
being the main culprit.15

https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/blog/responsible-business-blog/2020/tackling-waste-in-post-covid-world.html

58

FMCG and retail REBOOT

In light of this global climate crisis,
China announced in 2017 that it would
ban the import of plastic waste from
around the world. This was a catalyst
for change, and the world took notice.
It prompted Thailand and Canada to
impose a ban on single-use plastics.
Local action was taken in the US
with states such as California and
Massachusetts eliminating or working
to eliminate certain types of plastics.
In June 2018, Prime Minister Narendra
Modi announced that India would
eliminate single-use plastics by 2022.
Overall 127 countries have restrictions
on manufacturing, distribution, or use
of plastic bags, while some levies a tax.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit
the world, global decision-makers
were beginning to make meaningful
progress towards eliminating singleuse plastics. However, many of these
gains were lost when the pandemic hit,
as reusable items (such as grocery bags
and coffee cups) were abandoned over
fears of virus transmission. Instead
consumers went back to single-use
plastics to limit human contact and
decrease virus transmission.
To regain lost ground in the agenda
and reduce single-use plastics
consumption, governments,
businesses, and NGOs need to regain
momentum together by continuing to
focus on three key areas: innovation,
waste management and policy
reforms, and evidence-based decisionmaking. And, this must be done within
the parameters of our ‘next normal,’
where depending on single-use
plastics is not necessary. Economies
are rebuilt to optimise reusable and
design-out waste.
02. Sustainability best practices
By viewing sustainability through
the lens of growth and opportunity,
businesses have been able to apply
their creativity and innovation to tackle
some sustainability challenges, and are
also opening up new business models,
strategies, products, and services.
By innovating for sustainability,

businesses can also identify ways
to accelerate towards their future
business strategy.
Deloitte Canada’s sustainability team
is working with a global chemical
company to improve the circularity of
plastic value chains through blockchain
technology. As another example,
an automaker company anticipates
producing 22 million Electric Vehicle
(EV) units by 2030, when EVs are
expected to comprise 40 percent of
the automaker’s offerings.
Some businesses may lack the
necessary knowledge, skills, or
technology, to achieve the desired
scale or pace of their sustainability
transformation. Rather than building
or buying these capabilities, companies
can use the capabilities of others
within their ecosystem. For instance, a
consumer goods company has made
a commitment that 100 percent of
its packaging will be recyclable or
reusable by 2025. Recognising that the
company would struggle to achieve
this alone, it opened the Institute of
Packaging Sciences in 2019 to codevelop and test new environmentally
friendly packaging materials and
systems, together with suppliers,
research institutions, and start-ups.
The opportunity for system-changing
innovation is now. Consumers are
looking for new, environmentally
friendly alternatives and governments
are struggling to tackle the sheer
volumes of plastic waste.
Looking inside: Deloitte’s approach to
responsible business
With a longer-term narrative in place,
executives can look inside their business
to see what initiatives they could launch in
the immediate or near future to accelerate
the path towards a sustainable future.
Organisations that take a transformative
approach to sustainability have made
several characteristic shifts to think and
act differently, as illustrated below:

Looking ahead: Sustainability strategies
While looking ahead, organisations need
to focus on how to take advantage of
new growth opportunities related to
sustainable development, as well as what
threats and challenges may arise from it.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most
organisations have experienced some sort
of supply chain disruption. To be able to
sustain in the ‘new normal’, organisations
should take into consideration the
following practices from a supply chain
perspective.
Identify and plan for supply chain risks
Organisations need to put in place
processes to identify and ensure that
sustainability can be built in the supply
chain, end-to-end. Sustainability should
not just be a function of ensuring nothing
bad will ever happen (that is not a
realistic goal). Rather, it is a function of
designing and implementing processes
to understand, anticipate, and manage
sustainability, and its related risks when
they materialise.
Increase in transparency
To achieve resilience and improve their
supply chain, organisations must move
beyond tier 1 suppliers and go onto tier 2,
3, 4 and even beyond. They also need to
understand who are their suppliers, where
are they located, where do they source
from, etc.
Responsible businesses need to prioritise
sustainability over everything. The way
to do this is to engage with stakeholders,
have a candid discussion on key issues
affecting them, agree on areas where

there is a problem, and then look at
solving them together.
If a supplier is polluting an environment
advertently or inadvertently, responsible
businesses can join hands with them and
come to a mutual understanding on what
needs to be changed. Working together
to solve the problem can eliminate the
damage that other stakeholders are
doing to the environment, while also
depriving less responsible competitors
from engaging with that supplier. This can
send a strong message to peers and other
clients that sustainability is the need of
the hour and only responsible businesses
will be given precedence and priority
by consumers. Taking this “responsible
business” approach strengthens the
overall supply chain. This also protects the
reputation of the buyer’s industry – which
is a source of risk shared by competitors.
Re-assess the supply chain
In the ‘new normal’, organisations will
need to reassess their supply chain risks
and redefine their supplier relationships.
Earlier, cost was the primary criterion
to select suppliers. However, now that
is expected to be replaced by cost/risk
analysis with an emphasis on transparency
keeping the sustainability agenda in mind.
Re-assessing the supply chain will help
organisations achieve transparency as well
as supply chain resilience.
Building a sustainable supply chain will
lead companies to understand risks,
assess and monitor how their suppliers
are managing those risks, and diversify
their supplier portfolios to decrease
vulnerabilities.

It is the time to transform and make an
impact that matters
COVID-19 has created a need to achieve
greater sustainability. Environmental, Social,
and Corporate Governance (ESG) leaders have
outperformed during this crisis. Crises always
bring with them a degree of opportunity. As
the global economy starts to motor back to life,
investors are keeping an eye on sustainable
companies and industries, as they will be far
more resilient against future global disruptions.
Looking ahead, looking inside, and looking
around can help organisations understand the
importance of adding sustainability into their

62

business models, and identify opportunities
that can arise from a crisis. Sustainability can
only be long term if it is embedded within an
organisation’s policies. Responsible businesses
need to put sustainability high on the
management agenda and individual department
KPIs, to initiate action. Tracking progress against
well-defined quarterly and yearly targets will
help inculcate this practice in the minds of key
stakeholders.
Companies need to take these readily
achievable steps to meet the sustainability
need to respond, recover, and thrive in the ‘new
normal’.

Conclusive remarks
COVID-19 has fundamentally transformed
the world. As a result, the consumer and
retail sectors are evolving rapidly and longterm trends have been majorly disrupted.
Changes anticipated over the next few
years have occurred in the space of weeks
and months, having a profound impact
on the ways of doing business. To survive,
brands and retailers need to “REBOOT”
their businesses in real-time, with lasting
impact across many areas.
Brands need to realign businesses and
business priorities across manufacturing,
distribution, and product mix, enabling
them to respond to the crisis better. To
enhance and shape the next generation
of consumer and shopper experience,
brands have accelerated their investment
in digital and predictive technologies.
Further, companies are working towards

building a resilient distribution
network by expanding into new channels,
forming alliances, and collaborating
with distribution partners, to expand
capabilities and enhance fulfillment levels.
Safety concerns have led to an increase
in online “touchless” shopping, and
brands are unlocking the prospects
of increased sales by strengthening
their omni-channel play and moving
businesses to O2O, D2C, etc. Brands are
also updating their business models and
digitalising their supply chain to operate
efficiently and evolve with the changing
trends. Environmental and social practices
have gained paramount importance
post lockdown. Companies will thrive
by focusing on sustainability in such a
dynamic business environment.
