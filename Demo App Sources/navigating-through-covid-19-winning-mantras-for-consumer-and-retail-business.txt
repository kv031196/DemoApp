Navigating through COVID-19:
winning mantras for consumer
and retail businesses
Re-imagine, re-invent, reach out!
A detailed survey (our second edition) on best
practices adopted by consumer companies
operating in India while dealing with the global
COVID-19 pandemic.

June 2022
home.kpmg/in

Foreword
The recent 2020 report that we had undertaken, carried a survey of 140+ CXOs across multiple consumer companies to aid
consumer companies and retailers across India to comprehend how innovative strategies and best practices could lead to a
positive change over the long run. While we are not yet over the pandemic, we thought of attempting to understand how
business models are evolving in the new normal as businesses have now resumed closer to normalcy. As part of this survey this
year, we interviewed close to 100 CXOs across consumer companies covering 10 sub-sectors.
The COVID-19 pandemic led to profound changes in business models, driven by consumers’ preference for new channels
offering value and comfort. That consumers are still willing to pay for convenience has persuaded businesses to enhance the
online presence and go closer to them through innovative means.
Harsha Razdan
Partner and Head Consumer Markets
and Internet Business
KPMG In India

Analytics-driven culture is increasingly being practiced to understand consumers better and offer personalised experiences—44
per cent of our survey respondents, for instance, revamped their online platforms to ensure better customer experience (CX).
ESG has emerged as one of the top considerations for most customers, driving companies to align their corporate purpose and
values with customers’ expectations. Leading FMCG companies are creating their sustainability plans with a clear focus to
achieve net zero emission by 2040.
Industry data suggests that India's consumer digital economy is expected to become a USD1 trillion market by 2030, growing
from USD537.5 billion in 2020*, driven by strong adoption of online services such as e-commerce and education technology
(edtech) in the country.
The key objective of this survey is to show how consumer companies and retailers are adapting to new realities of the postCOVID world by detailing various steps taken by them. While digital transformation is happening at a rapid pace, cyber security
is an area where more progress is required.
As the saying goes – ‘A crisis is an opportunity riding a dangerous wind.’ Has your company adopted the new set of
opportunities to emerge stronger and embrace the future?

Key trends

Over the last two years, consumer companies
