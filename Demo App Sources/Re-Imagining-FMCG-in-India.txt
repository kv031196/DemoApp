Executive Summary
India is a large and growing consumer market . The next decade will see breakout
growth in consumption – albeit, with a fundamentally different shape of demand.
Decoding these consumption patterns would be critical for companies as they
reimagine themselves and build new capabilities to win in this new world.
As an industry, FMCG has consistently delivered superior shareholder
returns vs most other sectors. However, there is a wide variation in
performance across companies. A decomposition of the shareholder return
for the top 30 FMCG companies in India suggests that growth accounts for >
70% of value created over a longer term (3 – 5 years), much higher than
contribution of increase in margins . High performers (companies lying in
the top quartile of share holder returns) have been able to sustainably
create long term growth.
The overall FMCG market is estimated to be ~180 Bn USD of which the
branded market is ~65 Bn USD (34%). The market has grown at 12%
between 2005- 2015. We expect the industry growth to accelerate to 14%
CAGR between 2015-2025. By 2025, India's branded FMCG market is likely
to be 3.6X of its current size. i.e. 220-240 Bn. This growth would be driven by
significant demographic shifts : 70% increase in income levels, 100 Mn
youth entering the workforce, increasing nuclearization & 35% of Indians
living in urban centers.
The growth opportunity is clearly massive. However, more importantly, the
shape of demand will be very different. By 2025,
•

•

"Affluent" and "elite" households ( > 10 Lac annual household
income) will account for ~48% of consumption (vs 24% today). This
would result in breakout growth in several nascent categories and in
specific niches
Premiumization will accelerate - starting from unbranded to branded
at the bottom end and "luxurating" products at the premium tiers .
Companies will need to invest in building premium brands, delivering
the superior products through packaging, design and experiences



•

The next tier of towns (~600 cities with a population of upto 1 Mn) will grow
by 4.5X and account for ~ 45% of consumption by 2025 vs ~35% today. These
cities will add 30% of elite / affluent households and will be a key source of
growth for premium products

•

150-200 Mn consumers of FMCG products will be digitally influenced. These
consumers will spend ~ 40-45 Bn USD on FMCG categories (35% of the
branded FMCG market in 2025)

•

Conventional models of partner management would come stress. With 
increasing complexity at the last mile, companies need to embed
intelligence into the sales process. As new channels emerge, companies will
need to have greater clarity of the roles these channels would play

•

E-commerce will show exponential growth and may account for as much as
10-15% of sales in select categories

To win in this new reality, companies need to re-imagine the way they operate
today. There are four key imperatives (a) Creating a winning consumer experience
(b) Engaging the digitally connected consumer (c) Re-crafting go-to- market
models, and (d) Building people and talent readiness
Creating a winning consumer offer
How and why consumers make choices lies at the heart of understanding demand
and hence unlocking growth. We believe the biggest determinants of choice are
not demographics / psychographics but needs of the consumer in a given context
– that is, where the consumer is, who she is with, what she is doing and hence
what she needs when using the product. The same consumer behaves very
differently in different contexts and makes very different choices.
We advocate that companies embrace a "demand centric" approach that will
allow them to
•

Demystify the consumer decision making process

•

Develop portfolio strategy: Identify where brands lie, optimize portfolio for
maximum coverage & minimum overlap, address white spaces

7

•

Define 'relative investment' in the demand space portfolio

•

•

Communicate the brand positioning, drive innovation agenda and
execute in a commercially superior manner

Taking a segmented approach to retail execution : invest differentially in
service elements, trade spends, consumer offers and assortment

•

'Demand centric growth' has delivered substantial impact: growth uplift upto
10% , profit increase by upto 500 basis points for some marquee FMCG
companies.

Embedding intelligence (and analytics) into the sales call process by
leveraging IT

•

Expanding rural distribution based on a bottom up market view with an
optimal, cost effective distribution model

Engaging the digitally connected consumer

•

Taking a structured, strategic approach to new emerging channels: win with
winners, supported with strong execution measures

•

Enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of trade spends

While digital is a buzz word today, most FMCG companies are unclear on
the opportunity and the stance to take. Companies need to create a topdown view of the opportunity : revenue (& associated profit pools) and
degree of digital influence for that category to assess the role of digital and
the strategic position they wish to take. Based on the trajectory they want to
follow on the digital maturity curve, ccompanies can win with digital through
three moves
•

Influencing digital consumers and building deeper consumer connect
and advocacy ,

•

Creating a profitable e-commerce business,

•

Digitizing their core operations

These moves would need to be supported by recasting old world
capabilities for the digital world as well as creating completely new ones
Re-crafting Go To Market Models
With conventional go to market models under stress, last mile execution at
retail witnessing a wide variation, and emergence of new channels
(e-commerce, vertical specialists & Modern trade), companies would need to
rethink their Go-To- Market approach. Imperatives include
•

Creating scale, capable partners with strong governance

A successful intervention can improve cost effectiveness and quality of coverage,
reduce gross-to-net leakages and develop the platforms to drive the next wave of
growth. This can translate to an incremental revenue growth of upto 500 bps and
incremental margin of upto 200-300 bps.
Building People and Talent Readiness
Traditionally, FMCG has been a net exporter of talent to other sectors. However,
the changing landscape requires companies to re-think elements of their
organization model to become "future ready". Companies would need to build a
whole new set of people and talent capabilities across different levels in the
organization. Core people and organizational imperatives for FMCG companies
include
•

Adopting smart simplicity principles - leaner structures, eliminate
bureaucracy and build capabilities specific to individuals

•

Enabling transition of line managers to business leaders through a
structured intervention

•

Re-thinking the value proposition for entry positions in the light of the
increasing dichotomy between old & new economy career path

India's branded FMCG market estimated to be ~ USD 65 Bn, growing at 12%

India's FMCG market is
estimated to be ~USD 185 Bn. We
have defined FMCG to include
the following categories:

•

Packaged food

•

Beverages

•

Consumer health

•

Home and personal care

34% of this market i.e. ~ USD 65
Bn is branded with its salience
varying quite substantially across
categories.
For the purpose of this report, we
have focused on the branded FMCG
market. All references in subsequent
pages would be to the branded
component.
Historically, between
2005- 2015, the FMCG industry
has grown at a CAGR of 12%. The
fastest growing sub- categories
are packaged food (e.g. salty &
savory snacks, bottled water,

FMCG industry has delivered superior returns, growth largest driver of performance

FMCG has been among the best
performing sectors relative to
other sectors. As can be seen in
the exhibit it has delivered
higher returns than most sectors
– both in the short as well as the
long term.

FMCG sector has consistently delivered superior
returns vs most other sectors

Our analysis suggests that

in the mid – long term. Hence,
the variability in growth
separates the winners from the
rest of the industry. High
performing companies have been
able to sustainably create long
term growth with little variability
– that is the secret behind long
term value creation.

Volume growth in FMCG is less vulnerable to economic cycles

Our analysis suggests that
variability in volume growth has
very limited correlation with
variation in GDP growth rate. As
a result, growth in the FMCG
industry tends to be less
dependent on macro-economic
factors when compared to some
other sectors. As an illustration,
for categories like laundry care,
oral care, biscuits, the overall
volume variability in growth has
remained in a very tight band of
< 1% while there has been a
wider variation in GDP growth
rates over 2010-2015.
Contribution of volume growth to
overall category growth depends
on degree of penetration. For the
low penetration categories e.g.
deodorants, volume contributes
as much as ~ 80% of growth. For
high-penetration categories e.g.
haircare , biscuits, volume
contributes ~50% to the overall
growth. The remainder growth is
driven by pricing and uptrading.

Volume growth has low correlation to GDP growth
rate, especially for high penetration categories

Consumption growth driven by a 1.7X increase in household income

India's income distribution is
poised to see a significant change
over the next 10 years. The
increase in absolute income and
the change in distribution would
be a big driver of growth.
By 2025, 22 million additional
households will be added to
'Elite' and 'Affluent' class (i.e.
households with income over Rs
10 lac p.a.). Strugglers (i.e.
households with income less than
Rs 1.5 lac p.a) currently account
for 43% of the population. By
2025, they will comprise just 28%
of the total population.
As a result, India's average
household income is likely to
increase by 1.7X by 2025.
This increase in household
income presents an attractive
growth opportunity for Indian
FMCG companies.

The new reality: 6 key trends that would reshape FMCG industry

FMCG industry, today, is
witnessing a transformational
change.
India is seeing a fundamental
demographic shift. The rapid
adoption of internet (>600 Mn
consumers expected to be online
by 2020) , proliferation of smart
devices & increase in
consumption of digital media
could disrupt how consumers
make purchase decisions.
As new channels e.g. e-commerce
/ vertical specialists emerge,
companies would need to strive
for greater clarity on the role
these channels would play for
them.
To realize this opportunity
coming from consumption
increase, companies would have
to fundamentally reimagine and
reengineer the way they operate.

RERe–Imagining
–IMAGINING FMCG INFMCG

Significant shift expected in the growth profile of the industry

1

Share of consumption of affluent / elite households set to double to 48% by 2025

2

Share of premium portfolio to increase significantly

3

~ 600 cities (Tier 2, 3 and 4) would be 4.5X their size today & would account for ~45% of consumption by 2025

4

150–190 million consumers would be digitally influenced in FMCG by 2020. These consumers would spend
~USD 40-45 Bn (35% of the market)

5

Traditional models of GTM would need a rethink

6

E-commerce would grow and could account for > 10% in some categories

Share of consumption of affluent / elite households to double to ~50%

By 2025, 'Elites' and 'affluent'
together would account for ~48%
of the total consumption,
doubling their share from ~24%
today. This shift would have a far
reaching impact on consumption
patterns.
The exhibit demonstrates Elite /
Affluent households consume 3-4
X more than aspirers in some
discretionary categories while
1.5-2X for basic categories. They
not only consume more, but
consume more premium
products.
As the share of consumption of
affluent (& elite) household rises,
it would lead to a take off in
discretionary categories (e.g.
juices, deodorants etc.) which are
currently niche.

This would also result in
premium products taking off
across categories.

As share of consumption of elite / affluent household grows, it would result in breakout growth in some categories

Share of premium portfolio to increase significantly

Over the last 5 years we have
seen premiumization across
categories. As can be seen in the
exhibit, premiumization is
happening across tiers: starting
from unbranded to branded at
the bottom end and "luxurating"
products at the premium tiers.
This trend is also manifested in
BCG's Global Consumer
Sentiment Study which assesses
consumer behavior and attitudes
including tendency to trade up.
This study shows that relative to
other countries, Indian
consumers shows a higher trading
up behavior. As an illustration,
across categories , over 35%
Indians prefer to trade up
(compared to 20% in USA, 15% in
France, 18% in Japan and 16% in
Canada).
With the addition of 22 Mn new
affluent / elite households over
the next 10 years, we expect this
trend to accelerate even further.
The key question for FMCG player
is how can they convince
consumers to pay a premium for
their products.

Consumption of tier 2, 3 & 4 cities would be 4.5X their size today

Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities (~600 in
number), i.e. cities which have a
population below 1 million, would
be the next drivers of growth. There
are a total of 93 tier 2 cities (e.g.
Allahabad) , and 494 tier 3 & tier 4
cities ( e.g. Jhansi).

Tier 2 (500,000 to 1 M)

Today, they account for 36%
of total spend on FMCG (~23

2025, the spend on FMCG in
these cities will increase by
4.5X (~104 Bn USD). This
would correspond to ~45% of
the total spend on FMCG and
~50% of the total growth
between 2015 and 2025.

These cities would add ~7 Mn
additional affluent / elite
households (i.e. 30% of total).
Hence, we expect these cities
to be the new sources of
growth for premium products
in addition to being the new
drivers of overall
consumption increase.

To capture this opportunity, FMCG
companies need to rethink their Go

brand communication with a lens

> 150 Mn digitally influenced consumers by 2020, would account for 35% of spend on FMCG
To assess the impact of digital
across categories, we use two key
metrics: digital influence and
digital purchase. Digital influence
is the fraction of category buyers
that use the internet for product
research, purchase or postpurchase. Digital buyers refers to
the fraction of category buyers
who buy the category online.
Today, ~55 Mn consumers are
estimated to be digitally
influenced in FMCG, of which ~12
Mn buy online.
As digital age rises (defined as no.
of years a consumer has been
online), there is a significant
increase in digital influence. 25%
of consumers who have been
online for over 4 years are
digitally influenced compared to
only 6% of consumers who have
been online for < 6 months
Projecting this forward, we expect
that in 2020, 150-200 Mn Indians
would be digitally influenced in
FMCG, while 75- 90 Mn would
purchase FMCG products online.
These ~150 Mn consumers are
expected to account for ~ $40-45
Bn i.e. 35% of total spend on
FMCG by 2020

Traditional models of Go To Market would need to be recrafted

The conventional model of
partner management & retail
execution is under stress with
increasing complexity and rising
distribution costs. This has
resulted in high attrition both at
distributor as well feet on street
level limiting the effectiveness.
Companies are counting on rural
expansion as an opportunity for
unlocking growth, however, cost
to serve remains high in low
population stratas and there is
significant volatility in growth in
rural
The emergence of new channels
( e-commerce, Modern trade, and
vertical specialists like online
grocery) poses an interesting
challenge as in the absence of a
profitable model, FMCG
organizations are unclear on how
to engage
Trade spends are on the rise
however, companies have
undertaken limited initiative to
enhance the effectiveness of
spend

• High attrition (> 15% for some players) driven by challenged partner economics
(RoI, Low absolute earnings) due to faster cost increase
• Good distributors increasingly becoming a "rare entity" – especially in urban areas

Imperatives for FMCG companies in light of the new reality

This emerging reality poses an
interesting opportunity as well as
challenge to FMCG companies.
This report would focus on the
imperatives for FMCG companies
required to win in the new world.
We believe there are four key
imperatives

FMCG to witness a fundamental shift over
the next 10 years

1

Share of consumption of affluent / elite households set
to double to 48% by 2025

How can FMCG companies
create a winning consumer
offer to capture more than
fair share of the opportunity
in a systemic manner?

2

Share of premium portfolio to increase significantly

•

How can companies win
with the digitally connected
consumer?

3

Tier 2, 3 and 4 would be 4.5X their size today & would
account for ~45% of consumption by 2025

•

How should FMCG
companies rethink their Go
To Market to be “fit for
purpose”?

4

150–190 million consumers would be digitally influenced
in FMCG by 2020. These consumers would spend ~ USD
40-45 Bn (35% of the market)

5

Traditional models for GTM would be under stress

6

E-commerce to grow and could account for > 10% in
some categories

•

•

How should companies
think of talent and
leadership capabilities in
the new reality?

Imperatives for FMCG companies
Creating a winning consumer offer to capture
more than fair share of consumption and
premiumization opportunity
Engaging the digitally connected consumer
to influence consumers, building deep consumer

How consumers choose is at the heart of understanding demand

How and why consumers make
consumption choices lies at the
heart of understanding demand.
It is the key to unlock growth.
The conventional view is that
consumers are fickle and
inconsistent, hard to understand
and predict. This view is based on
the hypotheses that demographic
factors (life-stage, gender income
etc.) or at best psychographic
factors hold the key to knowing
what consumers want.
We see that the biggest
determinants of consumer choice
are not demographics /
psychographics but needs of the
consumer in a given context and
the occasion of use – that is,
where the consumer is, with
whom he or she is when using the
product.
So one needs to ask:
• When do customers use the
product?
• Who are they with at the
time?
• How do they want to feel?
• Which of their needs are
they trying to fulfill with the
product?
• How does the brand
compare vs. others in
fulfilling the same needs?

What is the occasion?

Who is the consumer?

Perception vs.
competition

What are the needs?

The same consumer behaves differently in different contexts

The same consumer behaves
differently in different contexts
when he / she is looking to fulfill
different needs.
If we ask consumers the right
questions, we begin to
understand "why" consumers
choose a product in a given
context.
As depicted in the illustration,
Sneha , a young girl in her mid
20s who is a mid level executive
in a MNC makes different choices
depending on who she is with,
what time of the day it is and
what is she looking for in that
moment. The predominant
choices of products and brand
would vary quite significantly
across the context and occasions.
This approach reframes the way
companies think of who they are
competing with.
For example, for Sneha the
potato chip brand competes with
not just other potato chip brands
but also indulgent products like
ice cream/ chocolates.

A demand centric approach can help in unlocking growth

To unlock growth, we go to the heart of consumer decision making process
and use "demand centric growth" based approach which is based on what we
call "demand spaces".

The demand centric understanding can provide companies superior insights
that articulate the "why's"—and build a demand map based on them. This
approach allows us to answer the following questions:
•

What drives choice in different consumer categories? And more
importantly, what does not?

•

What are the consumer needs that are shaping market demand? What
is the relative size of these needs?

•

What categories and products do consumers use? When, where, with
whom, and how do they use them?

•

What is the company's right to win, and for which needs? Where is it
vulnerable to competitive attack? Where is the white space or unfilled
demand space for the company?

•

What needs are competitors satisfying and how?

This understanding will help brands decide where to play and how to
differentially invest across demand spaces to win. A clear understanding of
the brand's target spaces will help in building and orchestrating an integrated
commercial plan to be the undisputed choice in those target spaces.

5

Dimension 2

A demand space is an intersection of context (demographic, where he / she
is, at what time and with whom) and the consumers' emotional and
functional needs. Each demand space is unique, with a distinct set of needs,
giving us a mutually exclusive segmentation of the market. Demand spaces
analytically demonstrate that brands which deliver on the needs of a space
outperform in that space.

The demand map lays the
foundation to assess the

Typically, several different
opportunity sets arise from
developing a demand map:

B. Under served / poorly served

Demand centric approach has created profound growth and changed performance trajectory

This approach has proven to
deliver significant impact across a
wide set of FMCG ( food,
beverages, spirits, personal care)
as well as adjacent categories
where customers make choices
e.g. restaurants.
This approach has delivered a
profound impact on growth, share
and profitability, fundamentally
changing the performance
trajectory of these companies.
The exhibit to the right captures
the impact this approach has
delivered in a set of FMCG
companies.
Business leaders have found this

Six tests for when a demand space approach is needed

In the exhibit, we have listed a set
of indicators that suggest the
companies may need a demand
centric growth led intervention.
The Demand Centric Growth
approach can unlock significant
growth in business by providing
the insights, clarity and direction
needed for growth. This approach
allows organizations to determine
whom to serve and why; and also
helps the organization
differentiate and win with these
consumers and occasions.
Using this approach in a
programmatic manner creates an
integrated insights foundation
that explains the drivers of choice
in a category. It anchors and
integrates portfolio strategy and
actions, to drive innovation and
activation.

Growth Test—Growth rate below ambition and/or history; constantly trading off price and volume
growth

Consumer Test—Despite 1,000s of pages of insights decks, cannot simply explain how consumers
make choice and why consumers pick your brand vs. the competitor

Segmentation Test—No or many segmentations, none at the center of the business or shared
across brands; or using conventional U&A as basis for setting strategy

Share Test—Losing share (even if growing) and cannot sharply explain why

Portfolio Test—Multiple brands attacking the same target, resulting in high cannibalization and
inability to grow brands simultaneously; absence of integrated portfolio roles

Commercial Cohesion Test—Different functions operating under different strategies, no consistent
language around the consumer and how to win their purchase

Companies can use digital in three ways

The disruption in consumer goods due to digital would increase at an
unprecedented speed. Proliferation in internet connectivity, evolution of
new business models and increase in digital media consumption would
provide companies enormous opportunity to create value. Others who fail
to capitalize on these opportunities would be under pressure.
FMCG companies can make three disruptive moves to win in the digital
world:
•

•

•

Shaping digital influence: This entails connecting with the consumers
along the purchase pathway by building brand equity online and
creating strong advocates for the brand
Winning with E-commerce: Creating a profitable e-commerce business
entails strategic choices around the channel – brand.com or/and
marketplaces / vertical specialists. Companies would need to think
through operating choices to avoid channel conflict.
Digitizing operations: Companies can create substantial value by
leveraging digital across the value chain to enhance efficiency and
effectiveness of operations

To realize these opportunities, some old world capabilities need to be

Recasting old world capabilities: Capabilities from the physical world
such as (a) product placement, (b) supply chain, and (c) partnerships
with retailers need to be recast for the digital world

•

Building new capabilities: Companies would need to build new "fit for
purpose" capabilities to compete in the digital world. These would
include (a) analytics based decision making, (b) a digital ready
organization, and (c) a nimble IT system that allows companies to
follow a 'test, scale and grow' approach in digital

Take a strategic, top-down view to the opportunity

Digital is the new buzz word today– however, most FMCG companies are
unclear on the opportunity it provides for them and the stance to take.

Strategic stance based on ambition & starting position allows companies to
determine the "end game" on digital maturity curve

We recommend companies take a top-down view of the opportunity : the
likely revenue (& associated profit pools) and degree of digital influence for
each category.

Leading
edge

The answer would vary by category very significantly. In some categories,
e.g. health / OTC, e-commerce would grow to account for 12-15% of
category sales by 2025 while in others, e.g. staples, laundry, contribution
from e-commerce would be much lower. Similarly for some categories, e.g.
baby food, degree of online influence would be significant (5-7%) yet ecommerce contribution would continue to be low (2-4%).
Companies need to assess their starting position, investment appetite and
the trajectory they would undertake (e.g. would they lead / actively shape
online or be a follower). This strategic view would determine the level and
shape of the investment required. This would help companies make a
conscious choice on where they would like to be on the digital maturity
curve and the path they would follow in the future.
Within the same category, organizations may choose to take different paths
e.g. a leading FMCG global player has an evolved digital offering (self
owned e-commerce portal with the option of personalized offerings for
consumers, active social media engagement, social listening for generating
rich insights) for its premium portfolio while continuing to have a basic
digital presence (updated website, social media fan page and e-commerce
partnerships) for rest of the portfolio.

Step up digital marketing capabilities : Take a data driven, programmatic approach

What digital platforms is the core consumer engaging in? Hence,
what platforms should we invest in?

•

What would be objectives for selected platforms and what campaign
tactics and engagement techniques should be adopted?

As the spend on digital marketing grows, so would the focus on efficiency
and effectiveness of spend. While most companies have started to measure
effectiveness of their spend through specific metrics tied to given
objectives, companies further ahead on the maturity curve have been
smarter and data driven in their approach to digital marketing. This entails
taking a programmatic media buying approach which seeks to buy specific
digital audiences rather than buying an inventory of click through.
A leading personal care player has adopted a data driven content creation
strategy wherein the digital marketing content dynamically adapts to the
audience type who is viewing it. This involves use of data analytics to create
smart creatives which are segmented and sequenced strategically as per
audience type. This approach has helped the company drastically improve
the efficiency of its spend.

Provide rich content and engage communities to win in digital

Digitally influenced consumers spend considerable time online engaging
with the brand across the purchase pathway. Most companies have
created rich, immersive content on their websites/ online platforms. Best
in class companies are pushing the envelope further to create engaging
content that is personalized, adapted to micro-segments of consumers and
co-creating products / solutions with them.
A leading beauty & personal care company engages consumers through a
mobile app offering that provides personalized suggestions based on mood
& outfit and allows virtual experimentation through a visualization tool.
Consumers are increasingly turning to trusted sources to seek advice.
Creating deeply engaged communities & powerful advocate networks has
become a key source of advantage for successful brands.

As companies build online communities, a key strategic choice is
leveraging existing social medial platforms v/s building own platforms to
drive community engagement. The decision would be based on:
•

•

Level of engagement: Existing social media platforms help the brand
achieve rapid reach, however, own platforms allow much deeper
engagement, relationships and rich insights
Starting position: For brands with limited social media presence,
harnessing an owned platform would entail considerable effort;
however, if the brand enjoys a high social media following, migrating
the fan base to an owned platform would be relatively lower effort

A leading baby & personal care company created an own platform of
mothers to drive advocacy. The portal serves as a forum for mothers to gain
access to new product launches, share experiences and engage in fun
activities.

Participate in e-commerce via multiple routes, manage channel conflict

Companies can choose multiple routes to participate in e-commerce :
brand.com or / and vertical/ horizontal specialists. While, brand.com allows
companies to build deep relationships with customers, offer
personalization and take decisions based on analytics for generating rich
insights, they experience much lower traffic vs market places. Partnerships
with ecommerce players, on the other hand, offer the benefits of higher
reach at the cost of limited engagement.
The level of investment per channel should be based on the role of the
channel and the company's ability to manage channel conflict. To manage
conflict, companies have typically adapted two routes • Differentiated assortment: Several options exist – Differentiated SKUs: A multinational coffee player differentiates
its assortment across its channels by varying the SKUs and by
retailing selected products only on its exclusive channels

•

Accounting lines between marketing and trade spend are fuzzy and
create conflicts when working with online retailers. This calls for new
buckets to be defined both for budgeting and managerial P&L

•

Incentives and metrics often push business owners to optimize channel
results vs. drive overall business

•

Promotions in stores and online, if not coordinated, confuse
consumers and/or sub-optimize economics

•

Assortment decisions need to be made across channels, but lack the
speed of independent decision making

•

IT systems and processes unable to provide one view of merchandise,
inventory and consumers across channels

Structure1

As companies adapt their organization structure to their digital strategy,
several friction points would need to be managed. Companies need to
proactively solve for it by selecting the right organization structure and
KPIs.

Hybrid: Organizations with multiple BUs, a collaborative culture and
moderate access to talent in digital/e-commerce

•

Built-in: Organizations with limited BUs, an experimentative culture,
and with top talent engaged in digital/e-commerce roles

Companies need to re-think their Go To Market model in the new reality

The conventional Go – to –market model is under stress
•

Rising distribution costs have resulted in challenged partner
economics and high attrition. More importantly, "good distributors"
are increasingly become a rare entity

•

Companies today face a wide variation in last mile execution in retail.
Most companies face a > 20% attrition at the front line level. High
attrition combined with increasing portfolio and channel complexity
has resulted in a wide variation in last mile execution

•

Rural expansion has given mixed returns with volatility in growth and
FMCG companies are still grappling with the right cost model

•

Emergence of new channels (Modern Trade, e-commerce and vertical
specialists) poses an interesting challenge. In the absence of a
profitable model, FMCG organizations are unclear on how to engage
and what would be the role of these channels

•

Trade spends have increased significantly & account for 25-30% of
spends. However, optimization of their allocation has been neglected
by most companies

Evaluate stance on partner management on four dimensions

Escalating cost structures have resulted in challenged partner economics
(RoI, low absolute earnings), especially in urban trade. This has resulted in
high levels of partner attrition – for some companies attrition has been in
late teens or early twenties. The problem gets compounded as the next
generation feels the distribution business has lower return on effort vs
other alternatives and has lower interest in pursuing the business.
Companies can address these challenges by creating scale, capable
partners, supported by enabling governance mechanisms and infrastructure

Take a segmented approach to retail & translate design to last mile

Retail execution is getting increasingly complex owing to proliferation of
SKUs, channels are becoming more demanding and complexity is rising
owing to increasing sophistication in asks from the internal category
teams.

How to segment?
Basic outlet
format
segmentation
• E.g. Grocer,
wholesale,
modern trade
etc.

This has resulted in wide variation in effectiveness of execution at the last
mile. Most companies have taken a differentiated approach to outlets
based on their revenue. Companies today have the necessary IT
investments to take a much more nuanced approach to outlets

•

Segment outlets beyond traditional criteria of sales: This can be done by
layering business potential , profitability and sales profile over the
basic format type segmentation

•

Taking a segmented approach to drive higher range selling in key accounts:
This would result in better resource allocation or higher sales per
field person – both in terms of time spent/ outlet and quality of
resource. This also manifests into key outlets getting a
disproportionate share of in-store inputs , visibility investments,
consumer/ trade offers and in some cases also a differential
assortment

•

Translate to last mile execution by leveraging IT: Enable last mile
execution by translating the design into on-ground action by
leveraging IT. This entails using handhelds to enable the sales team,
defining performance measures in line with design, and dynamically
revisiting analytics based on the POS data

Increasing granularity

Win with key accounts : Invest differentially to get superior returns

Different levels of sophistication (& granularity) possible in segmentation
of outlets. While most companies segment retail outlets based on outlet
format and some basic criteria, companies that are ahead in the maturity
curve adopt a more sophisticated segmentation approach by factoring in
other variables like, business potential as well , sales profile of the outlet ,
sub channel and outlet level profitability.
Best in class companies invest behind top- tier outlets differentially to get
a significant upside in the following manner
•

Service frequency: Invest as much as 12x man-days in key outlets vs
smaller outlets, often with more than one salesman calling upon
them, each carrying a different portfolio

•

Quality of sales resource: Deploy the best quality/ top performing
resources in key outlets

•

Trade offers & engagement program: Institute engagement programs
for key outlets with a pay for performance mechanism linked to
multiple objectives: sales, range, growth etc

•

Execution monitoring mechanisms: Deploy tracking mechanisms to
measure performance on key in-store execution metrics e.g.
plannogramming, merchandise execution

•

•
•

Visibility: Systematic investment in key outlets with payouts linked to
multiple criteria – sales profile, catchment of the outlet, location and
"real estate"

Leverage IT to embed intelligence in the sales call process
Last mile execution a key challenge: High variability in execution and adherence
to ideal sales call process

With increasing complexity, last mile execution is a challenge given
capability and attrition at front line sales force. Most companies face
attrition of > 20% for feet on street and capability gaps at the frontline. This
results in significant variability in execution levels.

% of outlets where steps of selling were followed/not followed during the call

Our work (refer exhibit) suggests that the level of variability can be very
high across the various steps of a sales call.
Best in class companies are solving for this by leveraging IT and
embedding intelligence into the sales call process. They have been able to
leverage several years of POS data & build analytics capability to

Step up rural expansion through right choice of GTM models

Rural growth has historically tended to be volatile subject to macro
factors. However, what separates winners from others is the ability to go
deep into rural with the most cost efficient Go To Market model.

Best in class organizations, have been able to effectively leverage geospatial data (GIS) overlaid with some consumption metrics &
infrastructure metrics at the level of a sub district / tehsil . Based on
potential of market and cost to serve, companies should assess and decide
the most optimal service model. As companies expand their rural
footprint, taking a segmented approach based on market potential allows
them to go for the most cost efficient model to penetrate rural markets.
For multi-BU companies there is a also case to evaluate leveraging of
scale across the entire portfolio to optimize costs and enhance reach. The
scale kicks in at three levels: distributor margins, feet on street and the
company sales team. However, it requires careful evaluation of the
underlying trade offs . This also needs to be supported with enabling
mechanisms in supply chain and IT to ensure the entire order to cash
cycle is streamlined.
Best in class companies are investing in low cost technology solutions to
enhance effectiveness of sales force in rural markets – they are able to
monitor, track and enable the rural sale steam. There is evidence to
suggest > 30% increase in effectiveness of rural sales teams when these
enablers and monitoring mechanism are in place.

Take a structured approach to emerging channels

Emerging channels ( e-commerce, vertical specialists, modern trade) are
in a state of flux & continue to evolve in India. In some cities these
channels already account for > 30% of the market. While these channels
have shown robust growth, there is limited evidence of a clear profitable
model. FMCG companies are hence, often unclear on the stance to take.
We advocate that FMCG companies take a strategic approach based on
clarity of the role of these channels for their categories. The strategic
objectives need to be translated to an implementation plan using a
playbook based approach for emerging channels.
This approach is based on:
•

Clearly identifying and investing in "winners" in the space

•

Creating joint business plans with the identified winners in the space

•

Restructuring Terms of Trade to maximize results .Introducing clear
pay for performance mechanisms with elements on growth, in-store
execution elements, and joint business plan objectives

•

Outlining guardrails in trade spends to avoid channel conflict

•

Rolling out robust execution monitoring mechanisms e.g.
compliance to Terms of trade (share of shelf, visibility, in-store
execution elements)

•

Laying out guidelines for the "perfect store"

•

Investing in integrated supply chains and IT systems for greater
visibility and agility

It is imperative that companies, put in place the right organization
structure with dedicated teams and the right KPIs to win in modern trade.

Enhance efficiency of trade spend through structural intervention

Trade spends accounts for 25-30% of overall spends for most companies.
Typically, trade spends tend to be disaggregated across multiple
stakeholders with no entity having a full view and are often legacy based.
As most of this spend sits above the net revenue line, it is typically
neglected. Most companies have limited understanding of the
effectiveness of spends and outcome metrics.
Our work with companies in India suggests we can optimize trade spend by
upto 10% (200-300 Bps) EBITDA impact through a set of levers
•

•

•

Reduce Trade spends by considering a few key factors based on
– Affordability of the spend for a given level of product margins
– Level of competitive intensity
– Ability of the retailer to distinguish total spend levels vs
competition
– Costs to serve and returns for channels
Reallocate spend across portfolio (markets, products) to enhance
effectiveness of the spend based on
– Strategic priorities for the brand/product
– Level of competitive intensity
– Brand strength and relative market share
– Spend types that can make payouts performance linked
Plug leakage arising from multiple sources such as
– Misclassification of channel partners
– Incorrect interpretation/ pay-outs on schemes
– Manual payouts leading to leakages
– Weak linkage to targets

To realize this opportunity, most companies would need to make a
structured intervention and enable it with a robust organization structure,
realigned performance measures and decisions rights, and an IT system
that ensures last mile execution.

Imperative to build people and talent capabilities for the new world

With the profound change in the shape of the future growth, FMCG
companies would need to re-think elements of their organization model to
become "future ready". This would entail not just a reorganization but in
some cases a de-novo look at the structure as well as building new age
capabilities e.g. analytics based decision making to win in the new world.
As can be seen in the exhibit, the constraint for growth varies by size of
the company. For most FMCG companies the two biggest challenges are
putting in place the right organization model across levels and solving for
complexity which comes with scale. In this chapter, we have focussed on
these two core issues

Inflection points and constraints in an organization's growth journey

Capital

Strategy

Organization

Complexity

Bureaucracy

We believe the three key imperatives for FMCG companies are as under:
•

Reduce complicatedness: Adopt smart simplicity principles- leaner
structures, eliminate bureaucracy and build capabilities specific to
individuals

•

Create business leaders: Enable transition from line managers to
business leaders through a structured intervention

•

Rethink value proposition: rethink the value proposition for entry
positions in the light of increasing dichotomy between old & new
economy career paths

Reduce complicatedness: Adopt smart simplicity

•

Slow decision making with processes takes longer than usual

•

Proliferation of coordination meetings and roles with people spending
too much time in one meeting or another

•

Silo working or repetitive work being done

As an illustration, one of our clients has to manage close to 10 stakeholders
across the value chain in order to get a promotion signed off for a brand.
The complex system has reduced the company’s agility and decreased the
sense of ownership.
Companies facing these situations must think about their structure from
scratch. The current environment and flexibility should be incorporated
into a brand new mode of working. When designing the organization, we
use the principles of what we call Smart Simplicity. Smart Simplicity is
about managing complexity without complicating things even more. This in
the long run, helps improve organization performance and employee
satisfaction at work.
The route to Smart Simplicity involves three steps •

Less Structure: Focus on value-adding roles and removing layers

•

Less Bureaucracy: Eliminate waste in processes while ensuring
suitable systems support

•

More Capabilities: Create new capabilities at individual, team and
organizational levels

More capabilities

Most FMCG companies have made changes in their organization in a
piecemeal manner to respond to a change in the environment e.g. addition
of new account teams (for modern trade and now e-commerce), or new
centres of excellence. Over time, these additions have complicated how
business is done. It is not uncommon for companies to believe that the
solution to the problem lies in adding more KPIs, more governance and
more coordinators. As this organization design remains unchecked, the
organization starts feeling the symptoms of what we call complicatedness.

Transition from functional managers to good business leaders

Most middle managers who have risen through the ranks are excellent in
their functional roles but lack the necessary skill set to be great business
managers.

Intervention most applicable for middle management

Many companies have started inculcating these skills with short term
initiatives such as executive programs. This is a good start but not
sufficient. In order to truly make an impact and build capability , a
structural intervention would be needed. This intervention is given
through a combination of role enhancement, class room training and on
the job apprenticeship.

Manages a
business

Key elements that are required are a combination of functional capability
builds (hard tools), soft skills and building leadership competencies.
•

Hard elements: These tools enable decision making, managing by
exception, and allow the managers to make proactive interventions
by giving them a snapshot of the most important trends

•

Soft elements: Building soft skills that allow mid level managers to
collaborate better with other functions, coach and mentor junior
teams while focusing on honing their leadership competencies

•

Business capabilities: Typically, when people are promoted from the
field, strategic planning is a commonly highlighted skill gap.
Transmitting these skills to junior teams takes time and often takes
place in an unstructured manner. However, putting these tools
together into codified blueprints can accelerate the learning curve
and ease the management of business performance at every level

•

Role enhancement: Structurally enhancing roles at the midmanagement levels by encouraging collaboration and getting a
functional overview with other functions either through direct or
indirect reporting

Create a winning value proposition at the entry level

Millennials joining the entry level today face an increasing dichotomy
between old and new economy career paths. They like working in loose
teams instead of hierarchy, are optimistic , multi-cultural , curious and
open. The expectations of millennials about career growth and work life
balance vary significantly from those of past generations. Job security is not
the number one priority for the millennials. Career satisfaction is. Hence, a
rethink of the value proposition is necessary
It is common for a conventional FMCG companies to have 15+ levels to
CEO. This has been driven by the approach of using promotion as a
substitute for motivation. Often these seemingly life changing promotions
don’t add any power, skills or responsibilities, and therefore frustrate
millennials who are not really motivated by just fancy titles.
Organizations need to develop a structured approach to defining the
employee experience. Steps to take include the following -

•

Define the value proposition: Be clear and articulate about the
experience and how it can be made better.

•

Back it up with clear learning experiences: Structured learning from
experienced hands and having a back-bone to lean on implies a much
higher probability of success.

•

Organize to deliver it: Relook at career paths, explore incubators with
the organization and structure a non-traditional path that adds value
to the business.

More importantly, organizations should take a step back and explore if the
experience based hierarchy is still relevant for their context. Perhaps
companies would be better off staffing roles based on relevance i.e. a set of
lateral experiences that make the person relevant for the role.

Relevance versus Experience
What is the secret sauce behind the energy at start-ups? Some would argue
that it’s the buzz of the place. Where does that drive & engagement come
from? Our view is that giving people roles and responsibilities far in excess of
their experience works very well for millennials.
It’s a tough balance, risk vs. reward; start-ups eschew the traditional experience
based process to putting people into roles. They primarily (because they have
to) use relevance to build up capabilities for roles that never existed in the
past.
Take for example, a role to sell on-line a category that has never been sold
before – let's say bespoke suits. Would you rather give the job to someone who
has ten years experience in suit selling or someone who understands how
shoppers shop online. Or maybe somebody who has done both?
What many companies may find is the relevant skill set is not always found in
the individual but in the team. Putting the right teams together in regimented
hierarchies is not easy and therefore established companies struggle unlike
their smaller, more nimble counterparts.
We contrast the organization philosophies between established companies and
start-ups using the example of an orchestra and a jazz band. Both require
intense training and talent, but the first uses a far more regimented approach
than the latter. Start-ups create the jazz band, putting together a flexible skill
set of very talented folks to get the job done and they pull each other to greater
heights as do all fantastic jazz bands.
One would argue, to attract and retain the young talent for the future,
established companies need a way to set up jazz bands. To not stretch the
analogy any further, the secret is in teams and more importantly, empowered
teams. Crack teams to disrupt the system, challenge existing thinking and
build a diverse skill set with the flexibility to experiment. So think about
teaming structures to engage people and the contemporary jazz archetype of
teams which would appeal to the contemporary employee.
