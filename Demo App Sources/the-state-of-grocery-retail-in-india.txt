Preface
With 12 mn grocery retail outlets, a million wholesalers and distributors,1 and a multitiered structure, the Indian grocery retail ecosystem is one of the most complex in
the world. Over the past 10 years, gradual shifts, such as the onslaught of modern
trade, the entry of cash and carry, the advent of the e-commerce revolution and, more
recently, the growth in new-age B2B providers have begun to transform this ecosystem.
To add to it, the Indian consumer has been evolving dynamically in their quest for
convenience, health and value. The pandemic that forced everyone to stay home
further accelerated many of these trends.
The year 2021 was defined by sinusoidal changes and uncertainties for the Indian
consumer, and consequently for grocery retailers as well. The grocery landscape has a
transformation underway, with multiple winds guiding this shift:
— Digital adoption: With close to 500 mn2 Indians connecting on the Internet and
more than 100 mn making transactions, the country has seen one of the fastest
accelerations in digital adoption anywhere in the world
— Innovation: Rapid digitization has made way for new start-ups, which have built or
adapted their operating models to the Indian context
— Direct-to-consumer (D2C): A market-shifting force that is transforming the way
Indians shop
These changes in the grocery retail landscape are giving brands and retailers much to
think about in the pursuit of popularity and profitability. The eventual path to success for
retailers seems to be to strengthen their core and be the first to develop new capabilities
in omnichannel, analytics and personalization. For brands, it could be critical to think
about strengthening their core channels while building new ones and also embedding the
capabilities required to sustain these shifts.

A source of sustenance and nourishment for human beings, grocery and its retail are heavily
defined by the needs of its consumers. As the nature of demand changes in India, it will
determine the way the grocery retail industry responds and evolves.
Two major forces of change are shaping preferences and demand in the grocery retail space.
One is the sheer knowledge to which the average Indian consumer has access, transforming
their and their household’s shopping behaviour. Four key themes are currently influencing
consumer choices: value, digital offerings, willingness to experiment and preference for
niche items. The second shift is where this demand is coming from – the epicentres of growth
momentum continue to be polarized between urban and rural areas in India. While the semiurban areas and emerging cities are expected to drive the next wave of value growth due to the
rapid rate of urbanization, rural demand is likely to continue driving volume growth.

01

The next-generation consumer
With half a billion internet subscribers,
digital adoption in India has fundamentally
changed the access to information and
choices for households3. “Stay-at- home”
access to a customized assortment of
thousands of stock-keeping units, the
irresistible option to compare prices across
multiple platforms, and the expectation of
doorstep delivery all mean the customer
can cut through the clutter and make
discriminating choices from the comfort of
their sofas.
These choices are manifesting themselves
in the way consumers interact with
brands, and how they choose among
different channels and options available
to them. A McKinsey survey of around
1,000 respondents across urban and rural
locations in India has led us to identify four
shifts in consumer behaviour.

3

Quality and Value as core
Over half of all respondents from the four
regions – East, West, North and South
India – shared that quality and value
are two of their key criteria while buying
groceries (Exhibit 1). Nearly a third of the
respondents consider the “best balance”
between good price and good quality as
the most important criteria for purchase.

Consumers consider value
to be a key factor in deciding

In a McKinsey survey of 1000 people,
conducted in Nov 2021, nearly 50 percent
respondents selected value as the primary
reason for switching to a new brand since
the pandemic began, especially in the baby
boomers and Gen X segments (Exhibit 2).

74 percent of the consumers, in the same
survey, expect to spend extra to “splurge
or treat themselves”, especially Gen Z and
millennials (Exhibit 3).

This spend is likely to increase across
several categories, notably, grocery,
personal care, vitamins and OTC medicines
and wellness/fitness (Exhibit 4).
Flight to digital
Customers have relied heavily on online
channels over the last year for grocery
purchases. Online platforms have been the
biggest gainers of this preference, with

Shock to loyalty
Consumers are finding it easy to switch
brands as they continue their quest
for variety, quality and value. Over the
past year, almost all respondents tried a
new shopping approach. This change in
behaviour has been much more extensive
among younger consumers (Exhibit 8).

2021 compared to 2020. Over half of
these respondents intend to spend more
on organic ingredients (Exhibit 9). While
organic foods seem to be a big stated
trend, the likelihood of conversion to such
preferences through online or offline sales
remains to be seen.

Two epicentres of growth5
The epicentres of growth momentum for
grocery retail continue to be polarized
between urban and rural areas in India.
While growth in the metros is likely to be
muted in 2022, the greatest contribution
to value growth (monetary value of
consumption) in the near future is likely
to come from semi-urban areas and
emerging cities, thanks to the rapid rate
of urbanization (India is expected to be
38 percent urbanized in 2025, a projected
1.4x jump from 2011 numbers – Exhibit 10)6.
Rural India, on the other hand, is likely to

drive volume growth (growth in quantity of
consumption).
In 2020, India’s metropolitan and Tier 1
cities contributed to about 45 percent
of the value growth in the fast-moving
consumer goods (FMCG) sector in the
traditional trade and modern trade
segments. By 2025, urban areas could
make up around 60 percent of all
consumption.

The retail space itself has been continuously changing to tap into emerging trends or cater
for new requirements. This has led to the emergence of five archetypes of disruption in the
ecosystem, of which the move towards omnichannel retail is the most notable.

01

Disruption in the ecosystem
Globally, around USD 42 bn has been
invested in the grocery space (excluding
mergers and acquisitions) since 2017.
Historically, investments in Indian firms
accounted for around 1 percent of the
total share. But 2020 was a golden year
for the Indian grocery sector which saw
investments of around 70 percent of
the global share excluding mergers and
acquisitions (USD 7 bn of a global total of
USD 10 bn8). Reliance Retail received the
lion’s share of this money, attracting over
USD 5 bn from the likes of General Atlantic,
KKR and Silver Lake.
Investments by firms such as Tiger Global
and Accel in niche players like Ninjacart
are also a testament to the growing
interest of global private equity companies
and venture capital funds in the Indian
grocery sector9.

disruption have emerged in the grocery
ecosystem today (Exhibit 12).
Of these, omnichannel seems to be
most predominant in the country, and
deserves a closer examination. Through
this disruption, ecosystem players are
looking to create an end-to-end value
chain, bringing brands and consumers
closer than ever. Furthermore, supplyside disruptions and shifting channels
have kicked off consolidation with in the
industry, with each player vying for a
unique vantage point. Key deals in the last
few years include:
— Amazon and Samara acquire
More Retail, 201810: This was to
enhance Amazon’s D2C offering.
Targeted expansion of More Retail’s
physical network of stores could also
strengthen its larger hyperlocal play.

The ascendance of omnichannel
Pure play e-grocers and hyperlocal
players, along with omnichannel
ecosystems have disrupted the grocery
retail sector, prompting exponential growth
and blurring the lines between online
and offline players. Omnichannel grocery
retail contributed under 1 percent in value
to FMCG growth in 2010, but has grown
ever since15.
Online grocery retail in India has seen a
cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of
over 50 percent, estimated to be USD 2 bn
to 3 bn in 2020, and projected to grow to

12

USD 10 bn to 12 bn by 2025. The top six
or seven metros are expected to make up
60 percent of the market and mid-to-high
affluent households could form the bulk of
the customer base16.
Serving customers directly and through
an omnichannel approach is emerging as
a prerequisite to growth. In our experience
with leading CPG players and retailers
in the country, the average revenue
contribution from online business has
nearly doubled in just the last three years.

In the modern trade landscape, Reliance
Retail has enhanced D2C offerings
with JioMart and the kirana ecosystem.
Discounters like D-Mart (Avenue
Supermarts) are also entering the market
with D-Mart Ready, which allows for online
shopping and home delivery. Big Bazaar 17
(Future Retail) has introduced two-hour
delivery to consumers through a proposed
seamless application interface18.
Beyond online and omnichannel grocery
retailers, the online market has two other
major players:
— Hyperlocal grocery players: Include
the likes of Swiggy and Dunzo and
specialize in express deliveries
(30 to 45 minutes), catering to the
convenience-seeking shopper
— Category specialists: Include Licious,
Milkbasket and others focusing on
niche categories – fresh meat, milk
deliveries mainly catering to brand
conscious customers

As grocers scale their omnichannel
business, customer acquisition and
profitability could help them to unlock
further growth.
During the pandemic, customers have
shown an increasing willingness to pay
for delivery, which itself helps to fund the
incremental acquisition of customers20.
Online grocers are tweaking their existing
models to strike the elusive balance
between attracting or retaining customers
while remaining profitable. Their attempts
include the following:
— Driving loyalty-based subscription
programs which could help recover
delivery costs and increase order
frequency by offering value with free
deliveries, quicker delivery slots for
subscribers
— Personalizing promotions and offers to
increase the basket size of high-value
customers and offering discounts to
price-sensitive customers

Hyperlocal commerce has witnessed
disproportionate growth in the past
five years and has attracted heavy
investments.
Meanwhile, profitably has been a challenge
for online grocers, which focus on growing
their gross merchandise value (GMV) to
offset high operating costs, investments
in delivery infrastructure and, often, the
customer’s reluctance to pay for deliveries.
Most leading players having a negative
EBITDA, while offline grocers typically
have an EBITDA of 5 to 8 percent19.

provides free delivery for baskets
worth over INR 1200
— Introducing private labels (especially
for staples and groceries) to increase

Cognizant of these changes on the
demand and supply side, grocers are
re-invigorating their proposition around
value (offers and promotions), quality (shift
to healthy assortment and emergence of
private label) and convenience (doorstep

“winning formula” for them? It could consist
of going all out, strengthening their core
capabilities and building new ones to
remain relevant and popular in an everchanging industry landscape.

Global examples indicate that omnichannel customers typically spend more and are more
valuable. Going omnichannel requires strategic actions of nurturing and retaining most loyal
customers, acquiring new customers and maintaining store productivity (Especially when stores
have been shut due to the pandemic). Shifting to omnichannel is a bold move, requiring retailers
to venture into an unchartered territory not involving native skills but a completely different set
of capabilities. They may need to re-invigorate their core through a distinctive customer value
proposition and an agile operating model, while building new capabilities in digital and analytics.
For brands and disruptors in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) space, the way ahead could
lie in strengthening their existing portfolio with a similar cost structure and distribution channels
while being the “first to build” capabilities in digital, analytics and distribution of the future.

01

Implications for retailers
Retailers could anchor their winning
approach around three themes.

the core value
A Redefine
proposition
Grocers are facing increased competition
from disruptors and an ever-growing
consumer demand for personalization,
choice and better experience. Being “all
things to all people” may no longer be
sufficient to win. Instead, they could gain
from building distinctiveness in one or two
areas, across merchandising authority
(assortment), in-store experience,
customer service, convenience and value.
McKinsey’s work and research in the
consumer and retail industry globally has
led to the observation that retailers who
successfully defined a clear customer
value proposition (CVP) against one or
more of these criteria have consistently
outperformed peers over the past 10 years.

28

The state of grocery retail in India

Brands and retailers could take a threestep approach to build and deliver a
distinctive CVP
1. Define a clear, customer-backed
value proposition and format
strategy. This could be based on a
re-evaluation of customer behaviour,
such as spend patterns, shopping
missions, and share of wallet across
categories. Companies could do
this both quantitatively through
transactions data and qualitatively
through research and survey insights.

Retailers and disruptors trying to craft a distinctive proposition could consider four
fundamental questions on customer behaviour.

1

2

What are the spending behaviours and shopping
missions of our current consumers?

What is the ‘headroom’ to capture share of
customer wallet?

 What is the pareto of customer spend ? In which
customer group(s) does the biggest opportunity lie?
What is the opportunity from driving basket size
versus frequency of visit? Which categories matter
to drive these?

 What is our current share of wallet relative to
competitors?
 In which categories (by region) do we currently
over- and under-index?

 What is the current distribution of shopping
missions and where do we under-index? Which
categories matter for the key missions?

3

4

What is our churn (and downward spend/
frequency migration), by customer segment?

Who are our key competitors and what is their
CVP/offering?

 How much value are we losing from churn and
downshifting each month/year?

 What are the head/tailwinds toward / away from
supermarkets?

 Which categories are the indicators of
churn/downshifting?

 What is the CVP of different competitors? How do
we compare on dimensions of the retail pentagon?

The box above features starter questions
for retailers as they begin their journey to
re-assess customer behaviour, their nextgen needs and implications on strategy/
growth of retailers.
2. Translate the CVP into specific
category tramlines (What does
the retailer/disruptor stand for in
innovation and assortment? What is
the private label play? How should the
value be offered to the consumer?).
These questions require category
level target setting for each lever (e.g.,
merchandising, pricing) that adds up
to the growth page. (see box on facing
page).
The state of grocery retail in India

3. Develop merchandising KPIs that are
essential to move from commercial
strategy to store-based reality:
These could include the umbrella
metric of Net Promoter Score and
drill-down specific KPIs of frequency,
number of trips, churn percentage
and average size of basket by subcategories.
In addition, any change in proposition
needs to be reflected at a store level
reality that is perceptible to the consumer,
including granular elements like shelf
display and store communications.

29

60%

of grocery retail in India is dominated by
Staples and Fresh.1
Leading grocers have started to invest heavily
in these two categories, which uniquely offer
potential for a price advantage and differentiation
through distinctive quality, fresh perception and
role of own brands.
To become the destination of choice in Staples and
Fresh products, grocers could focus on three areas:
1. Transforming quality from good to great:
Grocers could invest to improve freshness at
the store, enhance the quality perception of the
top items in the basket (e.g., potatoes, seasonal
fruits, loose flour/rice) and boosting product
attributes that matter most to consumers.
Better quality is tightly linked with the backend supply chain. Grocers and disruptors are
re-visiting sourcing strategies and supply chain
to minimize lead time from harvest to store.
They are laying emphasis on analytical tools and
practices, e.g., data-driven demand forecast
and ordering, technology-enabled quality
checks to minimize wastage at stores and
infrastructural changes to enhance freshness
perception at stores.
2. Offering greater value: Grocers could
invest in analytics-led pricing, promotions
and merchandising, as our survey found that
value was the second-biggest differentiating
factor for consumers. Staying ahead of the
consumers through data driven pricing,
personalized promotions and in the long
term, offering value through loyalty could be
a game changer for grocers. An integrated
promotions strategy including a calendar, a
promo effectiveness measurement tool and
cross category promotions could maximize
store level profitability.

3. Building private labels into powerhouse
brands: With customers expected to switch
brands and explore different shopping
behaviours in 2022, grocers, disruptors
and brands have the unique opportunity to
embrace private labels and transform them
into powerhouse brands for the stores/online
platforms. While multiple players have already
ventured into these territories by introducing
private label brands in specific categories others
are at the inflection point.
In South East Asian countries demographically
similar to India, large and growing consumer
segments that seek value and propensity
of consumers willing to try new brands are
developing private labels in multiple categories.
These brands come in wide variety and offer
quality that is similar or at par with national
brands at a price tag that is at least 10 to
20 percent lower. We find that such brands
increased margins over a five-year period.
As the shift to healthy and organic products
continues (based on survey findings), grocers
have a ready platform to foray into new spaces.
Those looking to explore a private label could
begin by thinking about four questions:
• What should be their consumer-led brand
strategy and economics?
• How robust is their new product development
engine in terms of supplier base, sourcing
collaboration and product launch?
• How will their category management evolve
in conjunction with existing national brands,
in terms of price, promotion, visibility and
placement?
• Does the organization have strong executional
capabilities?

the operating
B Revamp
model
Over the years, the back-end operations
for grocery retailers have become
increasingly complex, with omnichannel
supply chains, heightened customer
expectations for faster delivery and
lower productivity levels of the labour
force. Grocery retailers have therefore
been eyeing investments in automation,
mechanization and analytics across their
entire value chain. While innovation in
such applications is still at a nascent stage
elsewhere in the world, in India it could help
overcome the supply chain inefficiencies
and high operating costs laid bare by the
pandemic.
Retailers could specifically focus on the
following three areas as they look to
revamp their operating model:
Warehouse automation
Over the next five years, the global
automated material handling equipment
market is expected to grow at a CAGR of
13 percent – a 2x increase over the growth
rate of the past five years21.
Grocers and disruptors have started to
invest in the best practices of docking,
stock movement and planning flows in the
warehouse to swiftly eliminate back-end
inefficiencies. This also entails nascent
investments in automation and digitization
to weed out redundant activities such as
multiple instances of stock/crate weighing
across the value chain, multi-handling of
stock, manual MIS generation and manual
invoice sampling.

Analytics in planning and logistics
The retail analytics market is expected
to grow more than 20 percent annually
for the next five years,22 with a number of
enterprise resource planning providers
such as SAP and Oracle, and technology
players such as Locus, BlueYonder,
Loginext and ElasticRun, developing new
offerings. In India, grocery retailers have
started to leverage analytics to automate
their planning flows with varying degrees
of success23.
The typical benefits of automated planning
flows include lower levels of shrinkage,
fewer days of inventory in stock, and higher
service levels. Another application of
analytics is to couple it with automation in
the ordering and replenishment processes.
Additionally, a popular aspect of analytics
is to use it coupled with optimization
for transportation analytics – to create
dynamic routing solutions. The most
advanced solutions optimize trucking
routes in real time based on traffic
conditions and disruptions such as
road accidents. Typical benefits of this
technology include fresher products,
timely deliveries and lower internal costs.
Routing solutions can also be coupled with
sensor-based technologies to monitor
transport conditions, for example, to
detect quality issues around cold chain
transport that can damage or lower the
shelf life of products.

Our experience with retailers elsewhere
suggests that leveraging planning flows
with automation and optimization leads
to an integrated and transparent supply
chain, one that operates with minimum
human intervention and is able to make
decisions from ordering off stock-keeping
units to last-mile fulfillment under various
market conditions.
Workforce optimization
Dynamic staffing can offer a transparent
view, helping on-ground operations
teams to optimize physical staff and
the management to get almost realtime visibility of the optimum workforce
deployed at the front- and back-end.
These “intelligent staffing” solutions
through advanced analytics aim to lower
store and warehouse operating costs
and increase visibility of future workload
requirements – a capability that, when
applied successfully in stores and
warehouses, has reduced costs by 15 to
18 percent for some Indian players.
Such technologies represent a clear
opportunity for the sector, and companies
willing to invest early are set to reap the
benefits in their profit and loss statements,
outpacing their competition.

C

Invest in digital, analytics
and personalization
More influential and empowered than
ever before, customers have grown very
specific and distinct in their preferences
and requirements. The pandemic has
weakened brand loyalty significantly, with
90 percent of our survey respondents
admitting to changing stores, brands, or
channels in the past one year. Knowing the
customer and their changing preferences
has thus become quintessential to
customer retention, loyalty and growth.

32

The state of grocery retail in India

Increasing data availability also yields
an opportunity for retailers to target
customers based on their unique tastes
and preferences. Personalization powered
through data and analytics could be a
powerful tool to strengthen a consumer’s
connection with a brand, inspire their
loyalty, and draw them into stores. We have
seen several global leaders in grocery
who have excelled at personalization and
consequently boosted revenues, reduced
marketing costs, enhanced customer
acquisition, reduced customer churn and
increased overall customer satisfaction.
Given the nature of the next-gen
consumer, personalization and analytics
need to be omnichannel. Delivering
personalized, customer-centric, datadriven experiences across the customer
journey (from acquisition, onboarding
to loyalty loop) and online and offline
touchpoints (omni-channel), is a step-wise
process (Exhibit 13).

To move from campaign-driven mass
communication to consumer signal-led,
one-on-one, dynamic and coordinated
multi-channel communications, retailers
could think about strategy and the 4Ds
(Exhibit 14).
— Strategy – Based on their overarching
business strategy, companies could
prioritize a set of use cases in their
effort to unlock maximum value.
— Data – A Consumer Data Platform
(CDP) could provide a 360-degree
consumer view. It could combine data
across disparate sources (offline and
online) including but not limited to basic
demographic and behavioural data,
marketing and channel engagement
data, promotions and offer redemption
data. Retailers may have in place data
lakes to store their vast amounts of
business data. However, activating
this through a CDP and augmenting it
further through marketing and channel
engagement data, website clickstream
data might enable companies to

The state of grocery retail in India

optimize customer experience and
capture high value.
— Decisioning – This analytics engine
powers the core personalization
proposition – delivering the right
message, at the right time, through
the right channel to the right customer.
It can range from being an off-theshelf marketing technology platform to
a solution customized for the retailer’s
requirements and cost considerations.
— Design – Moving towards one-onone personalized communication
requires modern design and content
capabilities to produce, store, tag,
publish creatives, offers and content
dynamically, in real time. Furthermore,
setting up an agile marketing war room
to drive at-scale execution is a critical
component of this journey. At its core,
an agile marketing war-room is a crossfunctional team that drives speed,
testing volume and cross-channel
impact.

— Distribution – Delivering this
personalized, cross-channel
experience (across owned and paid
channels) requires a fully-integrated,
thoughtfully constructed marketing
technology (MarTech) stack that
enables seamless execution and
easy measurement and attribution.
While there is no ideal MarTech stack,
retailers could invest in onboarding the
right set of platforms/tools to deliver
their identified set of use-cases.
The MarTech landscape has a plethora
of solutions – ranging from full-stack/
marketing clouds to specialized point
solutions. Several well-known Indian
start-ups like NetCore, CleverTap, and
Capillary also offer a suite of solutions,
and retailers must carefully study their
requirements to ensure that their tech
stack is driven by their use cases, and
not the other way round.

34

The state of grocery retail in India

While these building blocks
comprehensively address the journey
to one-on-one personalization,
complete omnichannel personalization
at the store through in-store
operations and communication
requires certain additional
considerations, such as customer
identification in-store, triggers
incorporating in-person behaviour
(e.g., location-based targeting, in-store
beacons, browsing in-store), setting
up digital touchpoints for engagement
in-store, effectively leveraging in-store
teams to support.

Examples of omnichannel
personalization could include
integrating personalization through
encouraging customers to “opt in”
by downloading and engaging with
an app, interacting with a screen, or
sharing information with an associate
in a live interaction.

Organizations and brands starting their
journey to being omnichannel could
evaluate the answer to four sets of design
choices that might eventually help them
build a unique omnichannel proposition
that is also profitable in the long run
(Exhibit 15). The story of HEMA stores in
China is similar.

Making the shift to
omnichannel
The omnichannel business for retailers
seems strongly poised to become table
stakes for grocers who seek to be ahead
in the game and stay relevant in the next
five years. While leading adopters have
started treading these territories, other
grocers have started to focus heavily on
omnichannel as a strategic priority.
Sustaining the growth momentum in an
omnichannel setup requires the following:
— Investing in digital customer lifecycle
management and in supply chain
— Embedding new organizational
capabilities for change management –
and omnichannel category
management. The latter could entail
the following:
• Agile category teams working cross
functionally with supply chain and
sourcing
• Data- and technology-enabled
supplier toolkit for decision-making
support
• Capability building through field and
forum training from top to bottom

The Hema story
How a hyperlocal presence helped scale up omnichannel
retail and unlock profitability
Hema was launched in 2016 with a
modest eight stores in China. Integrating
offline, online, logistics and data across
a single value chain, the group now has
220 stores across China with a target of
reaching 2,000 stores by 2022.
This rapid expansion has been built on the
back of its unique value proposition: “Fresh
e-retailer with physical stores”. Hema
offers an omnichannel integrated grocery
shopping experience to capture offline
consumers and to drive online traffic
across scenarios:

— Delivery to home (order online →
cashless payment → delivered home)
— Take home purchase (visit store →
cashless payment → take home)
— Experiential retail and dine-in (visit
store → cashless payment → cook and
dine in)
Hema has put in place strategic business
guardrails as it attempts to convert traffic
from offline to online. These guardrails
are expected to help the retailer to unlock
economies of scale and optimize costs:

This omnichannel approach empowers
Hema to command a monthly revenue
4.4x higher than that of an average
store (INR 91,000 per square metre
vs INR 21,000 per square metre) with
its offline offering contributing to over
50 percent of the total revenue.
To attain these numbers, Hema has
worked to develop a deep understanding
of customer lifecycle management and
integrated it across channels through a
robust back-end and an efficient supply
chain network. The outcome – the average
profitability of a HEMA omnichannel store
is between 7 and 10 percent, significantly
higher than that of a typical brick and
mortar store24.
HEMA’s growth proves that the integration
of offline and online channels, with a
strategic impetus on online business is
key for brick and mortar stores looking to
plunge into their next wave of growth.

02

Implications for CPG companies
Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) players
of scale in India have been operating
with two big moats – their brands and an
intricately built network of thousands of
distributors reaching over 1 mn outlets
directly and another 10 mn indirectly,
through wholesale channels25.This in turn
gives them a big advantage on taking more
products to the market.
In recent times, however, several outlets
have been witnessing an income drop of
20 to 30 percent due to slower growth
and rising costs25. Steering through the
wholesale channel, which was the bread
and butter of CPG distribution, could often
be a frustrating experience for indirect
retailers. A visit to the wholesale ‘mandi’,
typically meant spending half a day away
from the shop, often at opportunity cost
and the additional expense of travel - a
direct cost. Wholesale also rarely offered
credit, leading to a significant working
capital hit for the retailer.
E-B2B is solving a lot of these problems
with easy orders, next-day delivery and
standardized credit.
These developments beg the question
of whether dependence on wholesale
could likely see a decline in the coming
years, and if over time, direct company
distribution could also be in potential
danger.

25

The rapid growth of “modern retail” ecommerce and the expansion of modern
trade to omnichannel—has resulted in CPG
companies reevaluating their commercial
cube (channels X brands X geography/
Tier). With the share of traditional retail
sliding from a historical 85 percent to close
to 65 to 70 percent over the next three to
five years, the implications are not only
affecting the approach to modern retail but
also leading to a review of the traditional
trade moat25.
There are two critical imperatives
for India’s legacy CPG businesses
when it comes to the disruption of their
distribution moat:
1. Strengthening their core distribution
2. Shaping the new channels
Both these imperatives require
embedding key capabilities within the
organization (e.g., DnA, redefined forwardlooking organizational resource allocation,
specialist capabilities to win with large
ecosystem players) and GTM stakeholders
(e.g., re-imagining the role, capability and
profile of the distributor to set up futureready distributors).

Strengthening existing
channels
Companies could tailor interventions and
programs by outlet type to meet changing
channel expectations.
— Segment execution to outlets by
classifying them on performance
(using internal data) versus potential
(external and internal markers), will
help strengthen relevance of outlets
that matter the most. Companies could
also optimize their operating model for
smaller, high churn outlets.
— Leverage DNA to make better
decisions.Granular external data is
useful to gain outlet-level perspective
that CPGs have long sought. Use
external and internal data together
through a list of high impact DNA use
cases such as expansion, extraction,
churn prevention, trade promo ROI
tracking instead of making judgmentbased decisions.
— Change management is critical for
DNA adoption. Ensure complex
algorithms are translated into clear
instructions for efficient execution.

Shaping new channels
CPG players could also take advantage
of market disruptions by setting up new
channels with eB2B and omnichannel
ecosystems.

Partner with eB2B players
Such partnerships could be a quicker way
to build new channels rather than creating
a B2B channel from the scratch. CPG
players could pursue three kinds of goals
with these partnerships.
— Portfolio: Expand distribution
of core and new products. This
can be achieved by focusing on
core pull-driving SKUs along with
an eB2B forward portfolio e.g.,
premium portfolios or larger packsizes. In addition, enable second
visits through eB2B feet-on-street
personnel.
— Channels: Accelerate growth in new
and emerging channels with eB2B
players e.g., pharmacy or beauty.
— Geographies: Expand to new white
spaces (specific geographies) that
have no presence or low market
share. Use eB2B partner as preferred
supplier in these locations.

Grow with online platforms and build
D2C muscle
CPG companies could focus on building
strong partnerships with online platforms
in the following ways:
— Performance driven digital marketing
— Leveraging their shopper
understanding to build online-first
products and packs26
— Using their data and relationships with
e-commerce companies to design
online-only promotions that encourage
shoppers to engage with products
The D2C channel has gained importance
with several CPG companies investing
in startups to build D2C brands – e.g.,
Reckitt Benckiser invested in the Bombay
Shaving Company27.
Build effective organization structures
to partner with omnichannel
ecosystems
CPG companies could rethink their
organizational structure to partner more
effectively with ecosystem players.
This could range from a standalone
organization, de-linked from the external
customer organization’s structure, to
an integrated structure that mirrors the
ecosystem design.

Standalone structures in companies with
lower omnichannel and e-commerce
maturity typically have a separate
e-commerce head with a digital and
analytics team whereas a fully integrated
structure has digital and analytics
integrated across the marketing
organization with designated heads
for partnerships with e-commerce and
ecosystem players.

The grocery retail landscape is constantly
evolving and retailers and brands need to
keep up to speed by adapting quickly to
these changes. Not acting is no longer an
option. With rapid digitization and capital
inflow, players are now equipped to build
an enhanced shopping experience for
customers by ramping up their existing
services or working with partnerships to
build an omnichannel offering. While they
do this, they must also be cognizant of the
new-age Indian shopper and the changes
in their behaviour as a result of the ongoing
pandemic.
