The COVID-19 pandemic continues to
affect the Indian economy across sectors,
including FMCG and retail. What was
envisaged as a temporary shutdown
for a few months in 2019, has continued
to extend to the second and possibly
third waves globally and in India. Each
wave brings its own set of challenges for
sectors as they face massive disruptions
across the value chain − ranging
from manufacturing and logistics, to
distribution and retail due to sporadic/ad
hoc and continuous lockdowns. We have
also seen major changes in consumers’
behaviour as they continued to study
and work from home for long periods. As
FMCG companies and retailers continue
to adapt to the ‘new normal’, they are
developing alternate routes to market,
building new business models (including
Direct to Consumer/D2C), increasing their
online presence while preserving their
offline stores and footprint, expanding
their rurban and rural coverage, etc.
They have had to embrace technology
and digitisation to make their businesses
more agile to minimise disruptions in
the future. With the shopper journeys
becoming non-linear, enabled by
technology and connectivity, companies
have had to learn to proactively respond

to consumers’ new shopping habits. With
high streets and malls reopening and
footfalls returning, FMCG companies
and retailers will need to adapt their
marketing plans to the evolved shopper
journey. They need to create a seamless
shopping and consumer experience for
their customers, and put consumers/
shoppers in the centre of everything they
do.
The Deloitte−FICCI report “RESILIENCE IN
THE FMCG AND RETAIL SECTOR” looks
at how FMCG and retail companies have
rapidly adapted to the “new normal” by
displaying resilience and their desire to
succeed and realigned their businesses
and business priorities to enhance
consumer and shopper experience. They
have accomplished this by building a
flexible distribution network, accelerating
the adoption of the omni-channel
strategies across brands, continuously
improving and digitising the supply chain,
and focusing on sustainable business
practices to operate efficiently and thrive
in a new business landscape.

Amidst the pandemic, the Indian
economy has emerged as a vibrant
economy and contributed immensely
to global development. The country
has evolved as one of the most
attractive investment destinations
with its expanding middle class, rapid
industrialisation, and a shift in the
demographic pattern. In our economy,
sectors such as retail, Fast Moving
Consumer Goods (FMCG), and e–
commerce are consumer centric and
can be the significant accelerators of the
economy soon as consumer confidence
enhances. The government is also
framing policies and putting in place
regulations to assist in mitigating the
pandemic’s impact. While India is one
of the world’s fastest-growing economy
and has immense potential, it needs to
promote participation and involvement
of businesses to enhance the cause of
nation-building and achieve the goals of
inclusive growth and empowerment of
the people.
The COVID-19 outbreak made it evident
how each and every economy is
vulnerable to disruptions in this VUCA*
world. As the vaccination campaign

progresses and restrictions ease,
businesses move from the “respond”
phase to the “recovery” phase. They
must incorporate various strategies to
their model with a special emphasis on
digital infrastructure. In line with this
view, the theme for Massmerize 2021 is
RESILIENCE.
FICCI Massmerize is a C-level exclusive
dialogue between the government
and the retail, FMCG, and e-commerce
sectors to discuss regulatory issues,
and macro-economic and consumer
trends. With the underlying theme of
‘‘RESILIENCE,’’ the FICCI−Deloitte report
focuses on analysing the FMCG, retail,
and e-commerce industries to explore
innovative strategies assisting industries
to be resilient.
We hope that the insights shared
in this report will help identify new
opportunities across areas such as supply
chains, innovative retail business models,
sustainability, workforce management,
and leveraging technology to improve
performance in various sectors, which
will encourage improved performance in
various sectors.

Executive summary

Madhusudan Gopalan
MD & CEO, P&G Indian Subcontinent
Chair FICCI FMCG Committee

The two waves of the pandemic have
rapidly evolved and transformed the way
businesses and the industry operate, the
way we operate as businesses, and overall,
as an industry. Companies and brands
across sectors, including FMCG and retail,
have been affected in every aspect of
the business. The crisis has also given
us an opportunity to adapt to changing
realities and meet consumer needs with
unprecedented agility. The FMCG sector is
well-positioned to rise to the challenge. In
the past 18 months, technology adoption
took place at a breakneck pace across
the entire value chain; this would have
taken several years in a pre-pandemic
world. Companies have accelerated
innovation across every business aspect
− product development and marketing,
manufacturing, retail, or strengthening the
organisational culture in the new normal.

Although the outlook for the FMCG
sector remains positive in the long term,
challenges remain in the near term.
The most competitive advantage that
will help businesses chart their course
through uncertainty, and the fast-evolving
consumer and retail landscape will be
RESILIENCE. Resilience needs to be built
into every aspect of the business rather
than bolted on as an additional muscle. It
needs to be built into the manufacturing
process, daily operations, retail and
logistic channels, consumer insights, and
communication. It should also be a part
of the way we recruit, train, and develop
people. This will enable businesses to
withstand short-term challenges and
continue creating value for consumers and
the economy. This year’s Deloitte−FICCI
report has the key theme as RESILIENCE:

As consumers and brands continue
to be more “KONNECTED” through
technology and the internet/e-commerce
ecosystem, brands must realise that today
the consumer LEADS the conversation
(moving from B2C to C2B). They need to
cater to consumers’ needs in their product
and service offerings. As a result, brands

must EVOLVE and REBOOT their business
models to succeed. The FMCG and retail
sector has shown resilience and rapidly
adapted to the new normal. With the right
support and interventions, the sector
will play a decisive role in fuelling India's
economic growth and making a resilient
comeback.

COVID-19 brought several challenges and created
fresh opportunities for trade channels in India. As a
result, FMCG companies were forced to redefine their
go-to-market strategies to create a digital ecosystem
spanning across channels to reach end-consumers.
Riding on the growth of online channels, FMCG
companies are exploring their D2C operations and
expanding their social commerce.
The FMCG and retail industries exhibited strong
“RESILIENCE” to overcome the challenges posed by
the first and second waves. As a result, 2021, so far,
has been the year of turnaround and innovation.
Since the beginning of this year, companies have
been using technology to re-engineer their business
models to find a way around frequent lockdowns and
closures, movement restrictions, and consumption
shift from offline to online.

The crisis forced companies to significantly revamp
their digital programmes and transition to the
future of work, with work from home becoming the
new normal. As a result, many organisations are
redesigning work, and exploring newer workplace
and workforce models. The hybrid workplace model
(physical and remote) is gaining traction. Many
organisations are gradually embracing a model
where the office could be used as a collaboration
zone rather than a pure workplace.

Each chapter of the report looks at current
major trends in the Indian retail and
FMCG sector from an Indian perspective.
The chapters further highlight some
best practices through case studies. We

The global pandemic has also pushed the FMCG
sector to adopt sustainable initiatives across the
value chain. With the fast-evolving attitude of
millennials, companies will need to focus more on
sustainable practices in their businesses, including
responsible sourcing and sustainable production
and packaging, end-to end visibility, integration,
agility, and optimisation. The global disruption has
also forced organisations to adopt agile planning
and forecasting as well as accelerate smart
manufacturing initiatives, digital transformation,
and procurement to stay competitive in the future.

COVID-19 also pushed the adoption of digital
technology, enabling kirana stores/neighbourhood
mom-and-pop shops to adopt technology to expand
their businesses. More kirana stores are going
online providing app-based ordering and last mile
delivery; offering a variety of payment options;
and automating their bookkeeping, invoicing, and
inventory management processes. The future of
retail comprises digitally connected stores with
customer data integration, real-time inventory
management, mobile POS, and store operations.

Redefine the channels
In India, the FMCG sector has grown
on the back of diverse channels, such
as general trade (GT) (kirana shops,
mom-and-pop stores, etc.), modern
trade (regional and national chains), and
online channels (Direct-to-consumer
platforms/aggregators). The COVID-19
crisis brought with it numerous challenges
and opportunities not only for FMCG
companies and retailers, but also for trade
channels. Although the impact varies by
channel, the channels have continued to
co-exist, serving as different customer
touchpoints. Many of them are trying to
bounce back as markets open up. While
urban India continues to be the most
significant contributor to overall FMCG
sector revenue, rural India's contribution
to the sector has grown rapidly during
the pandemic due to increased spending
power, large population migration from
urban to rural India, and rising consumer
aspirations.

India is witnessing rapid changes in
consumption and a shift in attitude
amongst customers. Online shopping
trends seem to have shifted from "buy
it if you need it" to "I will buy it to try it
and then decide". This shift in consumer
behaviour has led to changes in FMCG
companies’ portfolios. In addition,
technology-backed innovations, such
as demand anticipating algorithms, fast
order fulfilment through the digitised
supply chain, and digitised operations,
are enhancing the efficiency of online
channels.

Towards the later stages of the pandemic,
significant growth has been seen in
shopping through online/e-commerce
channels, driven by frequent lockdowns
of offline stores, movement restrictions,
overall trends of nuclear families,
rising inclination for consumption from
millennials, preference for premium
products amongst higher-income groups,
etc. Faster delivery by online channels
and multiple modes of payment have
also fuelled the exponential growth
of e-commerce. Riding on this online
shopping trend, major FMCG companies
built their online presence through
platforms and their D2C websites.
Online presence will not only improve
their availability, but also provide a
differentiated customer experience
and educate customers on their brand
products and usage.

• FMCG companies relied on channel
partners and distributors to reach the
targeted audience.

FMCG channels in the past
• GT (kirana, grocery, mom-and-pop, and
paan shops) dominated the retail space.
• FDI investments made a space for bigbox ‘organised’ retailers, cash-and-carry
players, and e-commerce giants to
enter the market.

• There has been a rise in Modern Trade
(MT), especially in metros, and tier 1
and 2 cities.
• GT remained the lifeline of distribution.
• Chemists/pharmacy channels were
expanding faster and becoming
relevant to the FMCG sector.
Channels of the future
• Growth in evolved mom-and-pop stores
(called evolved GT) will be fuelled by
technology adoption, digitisation, and
urbanisation.
• MT, both B2B and B2C, is expected to
grow rapidly in urban areas.

09

Resilience in the FMCG & Retail Sector

• B2B marketplaces (cash and carry
chains) wil target kirana shops.
• B2C online retail will be prominent in
metros/tier1 and 2 cities. Category
specialists/start-ups will continue to
target niche segments.
• E-commerce will continue to grow faster
in some categories, such as cosmetics,
baby care, and wellness.

• GT is expected to lose market share;
transition from GT to evolved GT will
continue.
• The emergence of omni-channel
distribution will merge all channels for
the consumer.
• New models – O2O, social commerce,
subscription services, EBOs, etc., will
have a sizable share of the retail pie.

Emerging trends in channels

In the retail pie, GT
share is expected to
shrink but remain the
dominant channel.

Retail outlets are
expected to evolve
into modern outlets
with the help of
technology and newer
models.

GT
Kiranas play a significant role in the Indian
retail sector and contribute almost 80
percent to the total retail, 11 percent to
GDP, and 8 percent to its total workforce1.
They have seen a strong rebound during
the pandemic, as most kiranas selling
essentials were allowed to operate
throughout the lockdowns. Most FMCG
companies worked hard to adapt their
manufacturing and distribution to make
products available at kiranas to ensure
that consumers could buy essentials. B2B
distribution aggregators/companies are
changing how kiranas were serviced in

the past. They are competing with FMCG
distribution to reach kiranas. Using eB2B,
companies connect with manufacturers
directly and procure products with
the aim of managing inventory more
efficiently. These companies also have
access to a broader category of products
to offer to kiranas in rurban/rural markets.
Small rurban/rural retailers using the
digital ecosystem have led to a rise in
the number of eB2B start-ups; one such
start-up became a unicorn in just two
years, showing the tremendous demand
potential in rural markets and new
distribution models.

New models within
e-commerce
O2O,D2C,e-B2B,C2C,
and social commerce
are emerging.

Resilience in the FMCG & Retail Sector

The eB2B space focuses on the mass
market, which is price-sensitive and
demands local products for faster
availability and convenience of payments.
Companies in the eB2B space also provide
logistics and lending capabilities with
delivery covering more than 900 cities and
thousands of pin codes. Their apps also
help gather direct feedback from retail
stores to provide deeper insights into
customer behaviour. These channels assist
stores in improving margins, profitability,
and inventory management, facilitating
wider assortment, and providing delivery,
logistics, and local/regional consumer
promotion services. Kirana stores are also
adopting digital payments mediums,
such as PhonePe, Paytm, and credit
cards, where earlier a majority of their
operations were in cash.
MT
MT, which accounts for about 12-15
percent of the total retail, was directly
and severely affected by COVID-19. The
pandemic led to a major drop in footfalls
as many high streets and malls were
closed for long periods. However, the
situation is slowly improving as consumers
have started visiting stores/outlets after
a reduction in infection cases and deaths
(following the government’s vaccination
drive). Even today, MT and e-commerce
are considered key growth channels for
the future. Last year, e-commerce growth
far outpaced other channels. As India's
middle class expands, leading to increased
consumption and spending capacity,
both channels are expected to continue
to grow. With three main competing
channels, brands need a differentiated
portfolio strategy specifically designed
for each channel. Some retailers have
even started accepting orders on calls
and delivering goods on the curbside/
parking lot; sometimes, consumers walk
into the store for pick up only, reducing
touchpoints. Technology adoption for
improved visibility of inventory, automated
backend systems, focused marketing
interventions, in-store sampling and
merchandising, better product displays,

and creating best-in-class customer
experience (driven by analytics) are some
of the factors driving modern trade.
Online channels
E-commerce, which accounted for only
3-4 percent of the total retail in early 2020,
has seen the maximum growth over the
past 18 months. The new-age customer
expects brands to "know me, engage
me, hear me, empower me, and delight
me". With rapid digitisation driven by the
growth of internet and smartphones, the
increased association of tech in everyday
lives has made online media and retail
omni-present. New-age consumers
engage with online channels throughout
their shopper journey – ranging from
discovering products, making buying
decisions, and sharing it with others, to
making payment, and thereby driving
repeat purchases. Heavy media spend,
deep discounting, wide assortment and
range, prompt delivery and returns, and
ease of payments, along with sentiment
analysis of consumers through social
listening (to see if a brand product has a
positive, negative, or neutral impression
on the consumer), have become a growth
driver for e-commerce.
Voice-enabled search has become
a major growth area for e-commerce
businesses, driven by the launch of cloudbased voice services, such as Alexa, Siri,
etc. In addition, devices provide regional
language options to enable consumers to
search and order products. E-commerce
channels also include voice search
optimisation in their marketing strategy
to further improve the search and provide
better options. Powered with Machine
Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence
(AI), these devices can capture shopping
behaviour and habits, and provide
shopper insights to brands. E-commerce
is driving personalisation, tailored
experiences for users, and relevant
recommendations for consumers, based
on the data they capture and advance
analytics. These are some of the factors
driving higher conversion rates online.

11

Resilience in the FMCG & Retail Sector

User-generated, content-based marketing:
A product’s positive reviews can nudge a
customer to try a product from a different
brand. This is the new trust-based,
peer-to-peer recommendation enabling
conversions on online platforms. A robust
pricing and marketing strategy, along
with many positive reviews based on user
experiences, can push customers to
buy a product.
Influencer marketing - With people
staying home longer and affinity with
social media increasing, influencers
(usually celebrities or well-known
personalities who endorse products
online for brands) are a force to reckon
with in this new digital age. Influencers
have a stronger connection with their
subscriber base usually following them on
social media. Companies engage local and
international celebrities to garner more
extensive market awareness with their
consumers. They also engage regional

influencers to drive conversions in
various parts of the country. Many brands
have reaped the benefits of influencer
marketing. This is likely to become the
single-largest medium to reach endconsumers, as many celebrities have
millions of followers, “following” every
move they make and every product
they use.
Another emerging online shopping
medium is social commerce, which uses
social media websites, such as Facebook,
Instagram, and Twitter, as a medium to
promote and sell products. The reach
is measured through likes, shares, and
retweets. It is still a small emerging market
in India. However in countries such as
China, one of the messaging and social
media app is commonly used for online
shopping; the company’s market value
rose to more than US$65 billion in
early 2021.

Resilience in the FMCG & Retail Sector

Rural markets helped FMCG businesses
stay resilient during and post-crisis
India has more than 650,000 villages, with
60 percent of the population residing in
these villages2. Many government schemes
and private sector-led initiatives have
helped increase consumption in rural
India over the past decade. For the past 18
months, the growth in urban centres has
been slow due to economic lockdowns,
etc. However, rural areas where GT acts
as a critical touchpoint for consumers, the
FMCG sector’s growth has been strong,
driven by large migration from the urban to
rural areas and major government financial
and development schemes (to support
rural markets, infrastructure development,
etc). In addition, rural consumers’
consumption habits are also changing
as they move away from unbranded,
unpacked products to branded, packaged
products, driven by higher income and
awareness. The rural market’s growth has
increased the size of the pie for FMCG
businesses. FMCG companies now need
to enhance their rural distribution footprint
to provide better assortment and range, to
keep consumers engaged with new product
segments. While urban centres suffered
during the lockdowns, the rural areas have
continued to grow for the sector.
A consumer goods company scaled up
its rural distribution network through
a programme many years ago – this
involved building micro-entrepreneurs for
distributing their products to households.
At present, the company has ~1.4 lakh
micro-entrepreneurs spread across 18
states. Many FMCG companies have now
successfully emulated this model. Another
consumer goods company currently has
a rural distribution network spanning
60,000 villages and aims to increase to
80,000 in two years. Adding products
(such as ayurvedic items) to the portfolio
attuned to rural consumers' demands and
expectations has further propelled the
sector's growth.
Challenges for companies to grow online
While FMCG companies find it easier
to start a Direct-to-Consumer (D2C)
model, the initiative is fraught with many
challenges. These challenges range from
customer acquisition and retention, order
fulfilment, payments, and returns. The
2

increased cost of advertising, leading to
limited visibility from social campaigns on
reach and conversion, along with high cost
of last mile deliveries (as a percentage of bill
value), makes the proposition of the D2C
channel less lucrative for FMCG companies.
Building a differentiated value proposition
has become key for D2C models.
Gaining customer loyalty is becoming
difficult due to increased noise and spend
on online channels. In addition, with many
channels distributing brands, channel
conflicts are becoming a major bottleneck.
To avoid channel conflicts, many brands
need to change their strategies and offer
exclusive/differentiated products, further
increasing operating expenses. In addition,
there is margin pressure as more retailers
compete in the marketplace. E-commerce
margins are slim, and shipping and
warehousing costs are higher due to last
mile delivery and a high rate of product
returns.
Many FMCG companies face challenges
such as a fragmented view of customer
journey, lack of inventory planning,
frequent shutdowns, changing consumer
behaviours, etc., which hamper their
growth. Organisations need to pivot
towards data-driven, decision-making
and digitised businesses to develop a
single view of customers and inventory to
facilitate frictionless order placement and
superior customer experience. The single
view of customer/inventory provides
better visibility to the FMCG company
to optimise forecasting and planning.
Omni-channel has become a necessity for
survival. Precise planning from customer
needs and investments in technology will
bring the omnichannel strategy to reality
and help realise the scale for businesses.
Omnichannel – The future of retail
Companies are creating a digital
customer ecosystem through connected
stores comprising demand generation,
capturing, and fulfillment. To meet rising
customer expectations, companies need
a holistic approach that involves creating
an ecosystem experience (instead of
building different experiences through the
mobile, website, and social media) using
every touchpoint together as part of an
omnichannel strategy.

Sustainable initiatives to
conduct business responsibly
“Sustainability is not a luxury or to be used as a
marketing tool; with the heightened consumer
awareness around the concept, sustainability is
becoming a business imperative.”
Understanding the green recovery for
the FMCG sector
The global pandemic has had an impact
on lives, livelihoods, and economies. With
more than 221 million confirmed cases
and over 4.5 million deaths worldwide (per
the World Health Organisation, September
2021), the pandemic’s impact in terms
of job losses and economic recession at
the national and global levels has been
significant. Asian Development Bank
(ADB) estimates that the global economy
could incur losses between US$5.8 trillion
and US$8.8 trillion, equivalent to 6.4− 9.7
percent of global GDP. However, the
pandemic has accelerated structural
change in the FMCG sector that includes
a shift in channel strategy towards
e-commerce and focus on health and wellbeing. These changes exposing problem
areas in the supply chain.
The FMCG sector is the fourth-largest
GDP contributor to the Indian economy,
with an estimated GDP contribution

of 20 percent3. With the sector’s
growth, consumer awareness around
products and the inherent impact on
the environment has become a point of
concern. Consumers with better paying
power have already started transitioning
to sustainable products and/or making
responsible product choices.
The global pandemic has triggered a
level playing platform for several sectors.
Revival plans have been conceptualised
considering sustainability across the
product value chain. Companies not only
address how they present and package
their products but also focus on what
material they use in their products. To
meet consumer demand, more FMCG
companies offer compostable, recyclable,
and reusable packaging. Additionally, the
use of vegan ingredients is on the rise
in food as well as non-food items, such
as cosmetics and cleaning products. For
example, in the oral care segment, a brand
has launched a certified vegan toothpaste.

“Sustainability is becoming the epicentre of FMCG
business strategy. From innovation in the supply
chain to energy efficiency in the distribution network,
the sector will take more steps towards reducing
environmental damage next year.”

What are the consumers looking for?
Consumers are expecting their products
to be made and distributed ethically with
limited impact on the environment. They
are also concerned about food waste
and plastic packaging. They want to see
consumer-facing companies exhibit
sustainable practices in their businesses.
For example, concerning themselves
with human rights, limiting their carbon
emissions, and reducing their use of
non-renewable energy and water. The
key drivers of sustainable consumption in
India can be recognised as:

India may become
the third-largest
consumer economy
by 2025 (consumption
expenditure to increase
three times to reach US$4
trillion)
Source: Retail Industry in India - Indian Retail
Sector, Market (investindia.gov.in)

Evolving consumer attitude and choices: Millenials and gen
Z are focused on how is anything procured and packaged.
Global market shift: There is a global surge in the
way FMCG producers are vieiwng value chains and
ensuring sustainability from cradle to bin.
Changing environmental and social
scenarios: The climate change is being
viewed as a crisis globally.

The major FMCG industry trends
that address these changes involve
sustainable solutions for product
development and packaging, improving
customer experience, and implementing
digitalisation. The key changes in the
consumer behaviour suggest the following
asks from companies:
• Sustainable Production:
In India, millennial population is
increasing and the average age is
expected to be 29 by 20254. The
country will add nearly 90 million new
households headed by millennials,
who were born into liberalised India.

5

These consumers have changed the
expectation of any business they
interact with. Millennials focus more
on procuring sustainably grown and
produced products globally.
The FMCG sector is being affected
substantially and is rapidly evolving,
pledging a move to more sustainable
practices and investments. This trend
is catching on with the Indian market
as well. A recent research done by
Stern Center for Sustainable Business
showcases that products marketed as
sustainable grew 5 .6 times faster than
those that were not5.

Resilience in the FMCG & Retail Sector

Sensing the change in consumer
behaviour, the FMCG sector has started
taking steps towards more conscious
decision-making. It is using lifecycle
assessment and emission inventory as
tools to rethink and redesign products.
For example, another consumer goods
company endorses its laundry detergent
brand with campaigns promoting efficient
water use. These products are said to use
very less water in the formula and require
less water to manufacture as well.
• Sustainable Packaging:
In the FMCG market, sustainable
packaging is moving from being purely
cost driven, towards using a strategic
resource management approach. In
the past few years, the market for
sustainable packaging in India was
driven primarily by cost reduction.
However, corporations are now placing
more thought leadership into their
sustainable packaging plans across the
value chain. With India being on the
brink of leapfrogging from a traditional
retail economy to an e-commerce
economy, packaging will become a key
aspect in ensuring sustainability of the
product. FMCG companies will have to
increase the adoption of sustainable
packaging, as it minimises the
environmental footprint over a
period. This can be achieved in the
following ways:
– Promoting the use of recycled raw
materials for packaging
– Ensuring an efficient production
process to minimise the production
process, supply chain, and carbon
footprint
– Enabling reusability by developing a
circular economy related to packaging
and extending packaging use. For
example, a company manufacturing
oral hygiene products in India has
introduced recyclable toothpaste
tubes. It is committed to transition
from manufacturing toothpastes to
recyclable tubes in the next few years.

Regulatory push towards
sustainability
The Indian government is making
efforts to ensure that packaging
moves away from single-use plastic
and becomes more sustainable in
the future. It introduced extended
producer responsibility to ensure that
hazardous waste, including plastic and
e-waste, is managed effectively and
responsibly. It is the responsibility of
the producer to collect and manage
disposed-off goods. This has, in a way,
laid new pressure on producers and
packaging developers to reduce the
environmental impact of packaging
as well as comply with regulations
while satisfying consumers. However,
this has also brought to the surface
the need for innovation to support
the sustainable packaging aspirations
of FMCG companies and retailers.
While FMCG companies and retailers
are making bold commitments to
improve both the sustainability of
their packaging and fundamentally
rethinking their packaging systems,
there is a long path for this group
to tread in terms of sustainable
packaging.
Key Example: A multinational food
and drink processing conglomerate
has committed that 100 percent
of its packaging will be recyclable
or reusable by 2025. It has made
a number of global commitments,
including the elimination of nonrecyclable plastics. It is working
towards achieving a waste-free future.
In 2019, about 87 percent of its total
packaging by weight and 66 percent
of its total plastic packaging was
recyclable or reusable.

Consumers’ awareness about discarding packaging waste into oceans and landfills is
pushing regulators and FMCG companies to adopt targets and make bold commitments
to rethink packaging.

• Ethical Procurement
In the past few years, with the adoption
of SDGs, businesses are facing more
pressure to prioritise ethical, sustainable,
and socially conscious practices across
their value chains. With the pandemic
disrupting the entire supply chain, it has
become more evident that the FMCG
sector cannot flourish without being
accountable for ethical sourcing.
In the future, companies need to
consciously identify blind spots across
the supply chain, ensure that the gaps
are bridged, and finally communicate
transparently and effectively with
stakeholders. They need to recognise
that ethically sourced products tend to
ensure a more secure supply chain. Also,
responsible sourcing is evolving as more
organisations aim to balance profitable
growth with sustainability.
What are the key aspects in the sector
to look out for?
The FMCG sector’s sustainability depends
on the implementation of sound ecofriendly practices that minimise the
negative impact on the environment,
help conserve natural resources, and
contribute effectively towards social
needs.
• Using AI for efficient growth
AI was deemed useful for a few
sectors. However, as the technology is
evolving, AI has found its applicability
to more sectors, including FMCG.
With the advancement in algorithms,
FMCG businesses can easily analyse
their production units and supply
chains to identify inefficiencies such as
security lapses, wastage, and quality
inadequacies.
• Data-driven changes
With the changing consumption
behaviour and pattern, customer
relationships are shifting to online
platforms. The expansion in data
availability and analysis has presented
an opportunity to understand a

suppliers accredited by independent
third parties to make its chocolate
bars. The company’s Cocoa Plan
operates across three key pillars:
better farming practices, better lives of
employees and their communities and
better-quality cocoa.

consumer’s needs. This has made it
important for the sector to rethink how
they can deliver products/ services
tailored to individual needs and create
an engaging customer journey.
• Embrace the change:
The Indian consumer landscape is
changing, with people now accessing
global trends and becoming more
aspirational. This leaves no room for
the FMCG sector to remain complacent.
It is becoming more important for
companies to ensure that they stay
in touch with the latest societal and
technological developments and
demonstrate a willingness to leapfrog
from traditional business models to
new digital approaches. This can be
done by ensuring that employee base is
representative of the diverse consumer
base and well equipped to apply
analytical skills to improve the products.
The shift to a more sustainable path
makes the future of the FMCG sector
exciting. The opportunities for commercial
growth, sustainability monitoring, and
operational efficiency need to be grasped
and turned into an integral piece of the
business model.

Leveraging Innovation
in technology
Role of digitally connected operations in modern day
consumer supply chains
Introduction
Consumer supply chain professionals have
long focused on the “four Vs” (volatility,
volume, velocity, and visibility) as they
attempt to optimise total cost, service,
quality, and support for innovation. A
decades-long focus on supply chain
optimisation to minimise costs, reduce
inventories, and drive-up asset utilisation
has removed buffers and flexibility to
absorb delays and disruptions. However,
COVID-19 led many operations to rethink
their vulnerability to global shocks through
their tiered supply chain network.
With supply chain resilience becoming
the cornerstone in the post-COVID-19
response strategy, emerging business
models (such as direct to consumer) in
niche consumer products, and emergence
of digital business models (such as payper-use) in consumer durables have come
to the fore.

broken down within the organisation and
are connected to full supply network to
enable end-to end visibility, collaboration,
responsiveness, agility, and optimisation.
These digital supply networks are
being built and designed to anticipate
disruptions and reconfigure themselves
to mitigate their respective impacts.
Early adopters and innovative companies
are shifting to dynamic and integrated
networks that deliver a continuous flow
of products, services, information, and
analytics for decision-making. Traditional
organisations are evolving their supply
chain functions to meet the increasingly
volatile consumer preferences, while
trying to stay ahead of the competition.
While the level of emerging technology
adoption and use cases are relatively low
in India, it is only a matter of time before
supply chains across industries would be
reimagined, improved, and disrupted.

From an India perspective, traditional
priorities are not likely to change.
However, supply chain decision makers
may achieve better performance, with
supply chain capabilities developed in a
non-linear environment. Fortunately, new
supply chain technologies are emerging
that can dramatically improve visibility
across the end-to-end supply chain and
support much more agility and resiliency
(without the traditional “overheads”
associated with risk management
techniques).
The earlier view of a linear supply chain
and optimising it for own business is
transforming into Digital Supply Networks
(DSNs). In DSNs, functional silos are

The nuances of creating the DSN will vary
from sector to sector and even company
to company. The FMCG and retail
industries would need to align DSN with
their business strategy while considering
risk management as an integral element
of that design. The key will be to build
a “resilient” supply chain that seeks to
reduce risks and is prepared to quickly
adjust and recover from any unanticipated

supply chain disruptions that occur.
When fully adopted, DSNs can cause a
paradigm shift in the operational delivery
for the FMCG/retail industry. Innovators
and market leaders would strive to
achieve operational digital congruence
– configuration of the right capabilities
in the right way within their operating
models.

Agile planning and forecasting
In the current environment, agile planning
and forecasting of fast-changing customer
preferences and disruptions require
a collaborative effort across multiple
functions (often working remotely in a
dynamic manner).

but something driven by internal and
external drivers that may be beyond an
organisation’s control. These require
articulating different scenarios rapidly,
identifying essential and at-risk suppliers,
and building capability to model the
projected financial impact. In line with
these changes, organisations are revisiting
their planning process, which have always
been a demanding and challenging task
independent of scale and scope. However,
in the current age of information overflow
and connected networks, these challenges
have become even more daunting.

In the ‘new normal’ driven by the
pandemic, demand does not necessarily
drive the entire forecasting process.
Availability of logistics, labour, or raw
materials may be equally significant
drivers. Forecasting is no more a
calendar and workflow-driven exercise,

Resilience in the FMCG & Retail Sector

As companies start on this journey of
shifting from traditional operating models
to insight-driven and agile operating
models, they need to focus on the
following key areas:

models, new product development
using real-time customer feedback and
upcoming megatrends, and extending
planning processes and visibility to
vendors.

• Keep the retail customer at the core:
Typically, organisations focus on
internal stakeholder requirements.
They have monthly meetings and a
sequential approach to supply and
demand planning. In today’s dynamic
environment, this rigid structure is
unable to accurately and timely respond
to retail customer requirements. Hence,
the operating model and planning
processes would need to be relooked at
with the retail customer at the core.

• Single integrated platform: The platform
should connect supply chain to finance
and sales and marketing; use common
data models, and be capable of real-time
data capture (e.g., through IoT) and
parallel processing. This would then help
the organisation fully unleash the power
of DSN.

• Focus on collaboration: The operating
models with focus on agility, allow
for new areas of collaboration and
innovation – hyper segmentation for
personalised customer experience and
targeting, collaborative distribution

Industry 4.0 and IoT
Ongoing disruption and economic
hardship caused by the pandemic have
increased the urgency for organisations to
accelerate smart manufacturing initiatives
to remain competitive in the future. Over
the next five years, agility will be key to
how manufacturers manage disruption.
Investing in digital transformation across
production and the supply network can
help manufacturers respond to disruption
and build resilience to help them thrive.
Several organisations leverage smart
factory’s components in areas such as
advanced planning and scheduling using
real-time production and inventory data,
or augmented reality for maintenance. A
smart factory is a more holistic endeavour,
moving beyond the shop floor towards
influencing the enterprise and broader

• Scalable and customisable: As people
work from home or remotely, real-time
access to systems would be critical.
Hence, there is need for stable and
scalable platforms that allow concurrent

ecosystem. It is a flexible system that
can self-optimise performance across a
broader network, self-adapt to and learn
from new conditions in real or near-real

production processes. Broadly, a smart
factory has five key characteristics:
• Connected processes, materials, and
equipment
• Optimised for minimal manual
intervention and high reliability
• Transparent network to enable greater
visibility across the facility
• Proactive approach for issue
identification and troubleshooting
• Agile operations to self-configure
equipment and material flows with

Consumer business organisations are
moving away from a single asset model,
which may not be relevant for them.
It is key to adopt a business impact
approach, with focus on improving bottom
line through smart factory initiatives.
Understanding the company-specific
situation will be key in determining the
potential value at stake of a smart factory
transformation.
The smart factory is an evolving solution
— one that taps into multiple features,
such as agility, connectedness, and
transparency. It requires more than just
a set of connected assets. Organisations

would need a way to store, manage,
make sense of, and act upon the
data gathered. Moreover, companies
would need the right talent to drive
the journey and the right processes in
place. Each smart factory journey would
require transformation support across
solution design, technology, and change
management dimensions. Investing in
a smart factory capability can enable
organisations to differentiate themselves,
and function more effectively and
efficiently in a complex and rapidly shifting
ecosystem.

Why is it important to digitise
procurement?
Digital procurement solutions have
enabled physical and digital inputs to
be connected, thereby driving improved
decision-making and efficiency. These
solutions offer the following benefits:
• Improved insights and strategies,
leading to accelerated cost leadership.
Embracing digital technologies can
enable companies save considerable
amount of costs.
• Improved vendor collaboration for
enhanced speed to market and easier
innovation aligned to market dynamics,
customer preferences, and competitor
actions.
• Enhanced process excellence, leading
to greater organisational efficiency
and effectiveness. With technological
advancements, different teams find it
easier to work in sync. For example,
collaboration with retailers has become
more seamless. Increased collaboration
and integration of data with retail stores
in real time is gaining significance, as a
means to sense and shape demand.

• While today’s globalised sourcing
and manufacturing processes are
driving down costs, they have a high
exposure to risk. Consumer electronics
manufacturers and OEMs will need
to invest in data integration, business
intelligence capabilities, KPI tracking
ability of suppliers, event tracking
capabilities, etc., This will ensure that
they are pro-active (rather than reactive)
and swiftly respond to changes by
improving risk mitigation.
• Companies are taking initiatives to
augment simplicity and increase
customer satisfaction. For example,
providing upfront inventory information
to the customer on the order placing
platform itself would make the platform
much more intuitive for the customer.
• With digital procurement, managing an
enterprise-wide transformation can be
executed effectively. Companies will be
in a better position to react quickly to
market trends and customer demands.

Key considerations to embark on digital procurement transformation

• Digital strategy – An organisation
needs to have a well-defined business
transformation strategy and execution
plan before embarking on the digital
transformation journey. Setting the
strategy is critical and often the hardest
part. Digital transformation projects
require a different approach and
thinking. Hence, a strong ecosystem of
experts and technology partners are
required to strategise, execute, and
reshape the business processes using
emerging technologies.
• Choosing the right partner – An
organisation should choose a partner
with an extensive technology consulting
expertise and experience in digital
transformations. They must have the
capabilities to use a wide array of
emerging technologies and technology-

enabled services to act as a catalyst
to the business transformation. The
organisation must carefully examine
their transformation stories, demos,
and detailed discussions to assess if the
company is a good fit.
• Digital solutions - The digital
transformation partner the company
chooses must thoroughly understand
the business goals, existing processes,
and the ideal technologies of digital
transformation suited for streamlining
business processes. The digital solution
should be customisable, scalable,
and flexible to meet the business
requirements. It must enable faster

and quick wins in this space. After that,
they must identify the segments needing
improvement on priority.

• Digital procurement transformation
primarily requires digitisation
capabilities. These capabilities can be
built internally in the organisation.
However, it often requires expertise of
seasoned professionals. Hence, external
recruitment is critical. In India, many
firms do not have advanced digitisation
capabilities.

Example
Digital transformation in procurement for one of the largest global CPGs
To move from an “operational heavy”
to a “value focused” organisation,
the organisation initiated a digital
transformation programme for its
procurement function. The programme
covers its markets and centres of
excellence in Europe, India, and the US.
The engagement led to the following
benefits:
• About 30-40 percent hours of
savings from buyers’ effort and ~10%
enhancement in Value in Purchasing
(VIP)
• Contract TAT < 2 days
• Supplier on-board seven times faster
• Automated and standardised global
price forecast generating platform improved no-touch forecasting and
forecasting accuracies
• About 90 percent NTPO and ZTPO
enabling responsive and intelligent

More than 12 million neighbourhood
stores, popularly known as 'kirana walas',
dominate India's retail. With ~90 percent
share in retail, kiranas are the highest
contributor to GT6; they have been the
backbone of the Indian retail ecosystem.
These kiranas (Indian mom-and-pop
stores, family-run shops, “paan” outlets,
etc.) sell various items, including groceries,
food, over-the-counter products, and
vegetables. Their importance grew during
the pandemic as they were classified as
an “essentials” business and allowed to
operate throughout the lockdowns (with
some restrictions). Indians have continued
to depend on their neighbourhood kiranas
for their everyday needs. This trend was
further reinforced during COVID-19.
Old kirana shops
In late 90’s, kirana stores deployed manual
methods of operations, including billing,
bookkeeping, and inventory management.
6

They were not accepting digital modes of
payment. Shopkeepers did the product
placement themselves; store layout was
sub-optimal and stores were cluttered.
Most kirana stores carried limited stock
keeping units (SKUs), were dependent on
distributors/wholesalers, deployed nonregulated credit arrangements, and had
little or no visibility into their inventory.
However, kiranas have continued as the
important link for Route to Market for
reaching end-consumers in India for many
categories. A traditional approach with a
solid distributor-led GT network ensured
robust growth for large companies.
New-age channels are contributing to the
growth of the retail market, creating new
opportunities for brands and consumers,
and challenging existing/conventional
RTMs. In partnership with these new-age
channels, many FMCGs and start-ups are
innovating to tackle issues related to supply
chain, delivery, payment, and credit.

How is Kirana evolving?
New-age kirana stores offer customers a
wide variety of payment options ranging
from credit/debit cards to UPI-based
mobile payment methods. They use a
range of technological interventions
to automate bookkeeping, tax returns,
inventory management, invoicing, etc.
Product shelves are better organised to
ensure maximum visibility. Some stores
allow a self-service model to provide
maximum convenience to customers.
Effective inventory management leads
to a decrease in a number of damaged,
expired products and increased inventory
turnover, while ensuring that consumers
get products when they need.
During COVID-19, these stores showed
resilience and adopted technology to
support consumers – taking orders
through mobile calls and WhatsApp and
delivering the same day . GT is a pricesensitive segment, but the stock turnover
is high. GT owners used their relationship
with brands and customers, and trustbased selling during the order placement
calls by nudging customers to try different
brands when customers’ requested
brands were not available during the
lockdowns.
Kirana stores have also expanded their
product portfolios, understanding
changing product adjacencies due to
consumer needs and expectations. This is
especially true as consumer behaviour has
changed, and the convenience of home
delivery has gained significant traction.
The trend has helped increase the basket
size (as there was a minimum order cap)
and brought cross-selling and upselling
opportunities for kirana stores. Based on
stores owners’ knowledge of customer
ordering behaviour and preferences, trustbased recommendations for different
product brands and categories also
supplemented the sale.
COVID-19 made some short-term and
long-term changes in consumption

behaviour. As a result, some product
segments that were earlier missing from
the consumer's cart, have become part
of regular orders. Kirana stores have
also worked on the visibility of broader
category items through anticipating
customer needs. Many stores have also
taken the initiative to go online and used
app-based ordering to speed up product
stocking. Further digitising this channel,
which is the most significant contributor
to the FMCG sector, will open new growth
opportunities.
Changing Ecosystem around Kirana
The FMCG industry is being disrupted
through digital innovation. Companies
and start-ups are innovating across the
value chain to service kiranas effectively.
FMCG companies are focusing more on
direct to outlets through their portals/apps
and marketplace models. Companies are
trying to make their products available
on-demand with multiple delivery options,
reducing the cost of supplying to channel
partners by partnering with B2B delivery
aggregators. Delivery aggregators also
help ensure the supply chain is robust
by reducing dependency on traditional
transporters. B2B trade platforms/
aggregators provide stock to kirana
stores while offering additional benefits,
such as easy returns, multiple sellers and
brands, and easy access to credit. With
access to alternate data sources and
new-age underwriting models, several
fintech players are offering kiranas
working capital loans across the country to
facilitate their business.
FMCG companies: FMCG companies have
a role to play as they deploy innovative
technologies around order taking, trade
promotion schemes, and incentives, etc.
FMCG companies also need to deliver
customised merchandising and optimised
product assortment to transform their
kirana servicing. Companies are facing
the pressure of channel conflicts between
traditional channels and online channels,
especially in B2B players servicing kirana

37

Resilience in the FMCG & Retail Sector

and other outlets. They need to work with
both the channels and their distributors to
ease these conflicts.
Supply Chain Partners: Intermediaries
such as wholesalers will also need to
transform and add value to the supply
chain in inventory management, financing,
assortment planning, and distribution.
Third-party logistics providers will need to
ensure that their systems and processes
support the transformation of kirana
shops.
Government: Suitable government
policies will drive the large-scale
transformation of the kirana ecosystem.
Systems that drive ease of compliance
and specific interventions from the
government will ensure that stakeholders
play their part as we shift towards a more
digitally enabled retail ecosystem. Retailer
associations can partner with government
organisations and technology providers to
modernise kiranas.
Start-Up and Technology providers:
Start-up firms are innovating to
enable kirana owners to accept digital
payments and easily access credit. In the
e-commerce space, players could also
partner with new kirana store owners
to solve last-mile delivery challenges in
semi-urban, rural areas. Several start-ups

38

also provide a host of business service
solutions to ease the burden of store
operations, thereby allowing kirana
owners/operators increase their customer
focus.
The way forward for Kiranas
Kirana store owners need to collaborate
with logistics companies to solve last-mile
delivery challenges. Large companies
can strengthen their hyper-local strategy
through partnering with kiranas and using
existing retail space as a warehouse to
supply to local kiranas. Kirana stores can
also play an essential role in enabling
other industries to connect with endcustomers to facilitate last mile connect/
delivery. Financial services companies
can use kirana outlets to provide ancillary
services to customers. FMCG companies
will need to reimagine their retail
ecosystem, while continuing to partner
with kiranas to leverage their strong
connects and trust with end-consumers.

Connected Employees in
the new work environment
Future of Work Accelerated?
As the world copes with the uncertainty of
the pandemic, India Inc. has been working
overtime, initially formulating responses
to the immediate crisis. Now with almost
a year and half of experience, the industry
is testing the efficacy and relevance
of different strategies. Government
regulations are also evolving in a bid to
support growth and employment while
ensuring that subsequent COVID-19 waves
do not affect the country in the same way
that it did a few months ago.
The Future of Work comprises three
equally important dimensions ‘Work’ (what
can be automated), ‘Workforce’ (who can
do the work) and ‘Workplace’ (where is the
work done).
COVID-19 as an accelerator in the
transition to the envisaged future of
work
Historically, the pace at which people,
businesses, and public policy have
changed has usually been slower than that
of technology evolution. With the current
crisis forcing change, we asked CXOs if
they see the change being sustainable,
and they answered in a strong affirmative.
The acceleration of the Future of Work
seems to have been due to a breakdown
of legacy mindsets, digital adoption,
and new demands being placed on
businesses and employees. This pandemic
has forced businesses and public policy
to significantly revamp their digital
programmes.

Is acceleration uniform across levers of
work, workforce, and workplace?
Automation and cognitive technology
investments have not been a focus area
during the crisis as leaders are largely in
the “respond” phase. However, we see
key shifts in the way “workforce” and
“workplace” are perceived:
01. Businesses have started bringing in
alternative workforce models and
leveraging the gig economy.
02. The idea of a hybrid workplace
(physical and remote) is gaining
traction. Many organisations are
gradually embracing a model where
the office will be used more as a
collaboration zone than as a pure
workplace.
Working from home is the new normal.
How is India Inc. coping?
To test our hypotheses, we studied 42
reputed Indian organisations through a
combination of survey and one-on-one
conversations with CXOs. We identified
seven key learnings from the current crisis,
which could potentially accelerate the
Future of Work in India.
01. Business Continuity Challenges: A
collaborative effort was required to
minimise disruption arising from the
attachment to physical assets, lack of
IT infrastructure, and social structure.
About 55 percent CXOs agreed that
their IT infrastructure (availability
of hardware, internet, and remote
access) fell short of facilitating a
smooth transition to remote working.
About 40 percent CXOs have already

41

Resilience in the FMCG & Retail Sector

initiated a review of how roles can be
redesigned to minimise attachment to
physical assets (heavy machinery and
confidential systems). Organisations
will need to redefine their HR policies
to enable changes in ways of working.
02. Adoption of Collaboration Tools:
The key shift seems to have been in
adoption of, rather than investment
in, virtual tools for collaboration.
About 75 percent CXOs said they did
not have to invest in new platforms
for virtual collaboration. Instead,
they saw a surge in ‘forced adoption’
of tech platforms. About 60 percent
CXOs stated collaboration seems
to have significantly increased. The
decision-making process has also
become more efficient, possibly
due to greater efficiency of virtual
meetings.
03. Workforce Productivity: Leaders
believe that individual employee
productivity has in part, increased
as a result of remote working. About
70 percent CXOs have reported ‘no
impact’ or increase in individual
employee productivity. Disruption
to the workplace has placed greater
demand on operations, IT, and HR
teams, as they had to play a larger
role in facilitating remote working.
Roles that require cognitive thinking
or independent/project-based work
have seen a positive impact on
productivity as employees manage
their time more effectively. At a
fundamental level, organisations
agree that productivity as measured
by clear process outcomes or hours
worked, has not suffered. They still
need to evaluate whether quality or
innovation has improved.
04. Employee Wellness and Learning:
As the crisis has propelled greater
focus on employees’ physical wellbeing, more than 70 percent CXOs
confirmed that their organisations
have set up dedicated programmes to
work on employee wellness. Several

42

organisations also made massive
collaborative efforts to manage the
second wave. The learnings from that
will remain with companies as they
plan future wellness initiatives for
their employees. CXOs also reported a
three time increase in training efforts,
as organisations use virtual channels
to impart future-ready skills.
05. Everyone in it together: About
90 percent CXOs say workforce
is putting in more working hours.
Absenteeism was significantly low
during the crisis. About 72 percent
CXOs also believe that the team lead’s
role will be important for leading the
organisation through the change and
their managers have been stepping
up to the task.
06. Agility as a key lever of success:
About 60 percent CXOs felt that the
breakdown of traditional organisation
structures helped them reorganise
based on priorities. About 85 percent
leaders stated that agility of their
workforce to adapt to the new ways
of working surprised them the most.
It was the one big takeaway for them
from the crisis. Organisations that
proactively created empowered
teams to facilitate large-scale
migration to virtual working reported
lower disruption.
07. Gig workforce: About 60 percent
organisations are evaluating
increasing the share of gig workers,
while 40 percent said they will reduce
dependence/maintain status quo and
favour the full-time workforce.
How will organisations sustain the
change? The journey from “respond” to
“recover” to “thrive”.
The move from ‘responding to the crises’
to ‘thriving in the new normal’ is likely to
depend on how successfully organisations
take their learnings into the future. These
learnings need to be applied across three
levers of the Future of Work − work,
workplace, and workforce.

Workforce Options

01 Automating routine
tasks: Using automation to
improve efficiency of routine,
repetitive tasks, and process
steps on a need basis
02 Systemic automation:
Deploying Robotic Process
Automation (RPA) to redesign
processes by eliminating
redundancies and redirecting
human involvement towards
cognitive requirements
03 Exponential automation:
Leveraging technologies
such as ML and Natural
Language Processing (NLP)
for perception and judgmentbased tasks to mitigate
dependency on external
factors and accelerate growth

01 Fully traditional workforce:
The workforce that is on fulltime, employment contract and
engaged in routine business
activities
02 Hybrid workforce: Limited
alternative employment models,
such as third-party contracting,
mainly with a view to optimise
costs with a predominantly fulltime workforce
03 Augmented workforce: Fit-forpurpose employment models,
with freelancers, consultants, and
contractual workers for specific
roles that are time/project based,
require niche skills, and can be
managed remotely

The COVID-19 crisis presented
organisations an opportunity to move to
newer workplace and workforce models,
with many decisions being accelerated
to support business continuity. CXOs
we spoke to believe the changes are
likely to be here to stay. Organisations

moving to the Future of Work are likely
to see it emerge as a lever of competitive
advantage in a post COVID-19 world. They
should consider redesigning work across
three levers, keeping the work humans do
best at the centre.

Conclusion
COVID-19 has fundamentally changed
consumer demand, challenged the
integrated supply chains, and altered
some category dynamics forever, thus
defining a “new normal” for businesses. It
has created opportunities for businesses
across the world, forcing them to
“respond, recover, and thrive”. Businesses
are taking this opportunity to understand
the long-term impact of the crisis on their
operating models and find new ways
to quickly adapt to the post-COVID-19
world. The FMCG and retail industry is
exhibiting “RESILIENCE” to grow and
evolve in ways that create more value in
the future for the entire chain.
Brands are redefining their models
to build a holistic approach covering
every touchpoint to enhance and build
connects with the next generation of

consumers and shoppers. Companies
are consciously identifying blind spots
across their operations to incorporate
flexible and sustainable initiatives as
an integral piece of their business model.
Brands are also leveraging innovation in
technology to be agile in their planning
and forecasting. They are digitalising
their supply chain and procurement,
undertaking smart manufacturing
initiatives, and building smart factories
to evolve with the changing trends.
Digitisation is enabling kiranas and
opening new growth opportunities for the
FMCG sector. Further, organisations will
have to rethink and reimagine their work,
workforces, and workplaces to keep their
employees connected in the new work
environment, position themselves for the
next phase, and thrive in new realities.

With consumers shifting to online and low-touch shopping experience, brands and retailers are looking
to integrate online and offline digital touchpoints to influence and enhance their shopping experience.

O
As organisations move to the recovery phase, in many cases, they are looking at next-generation
manufacturing (manufacturing 4.0), digital procurement based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML), sourcing, and physical network reorientation, to reach pre-COVID-19 volumes.

T
The COVID-19 crisis has put sustainability on the backburner in many cases. More governments
are likely to push for stringent compliance to existing sustainability norms and establish new
ones. The move will put pressure on businesses to increase their investment to incorporate
sustainability across their business strategies.

EVOLVE for Consumer (2019)
The third edition of the four-year
annual series of reports delved into
the major aspects of a consumer’s
shopping cycle where brands needed
to “EVOLVE” to thrive in an evolutionary
consumer landscape. Consumer markets
are evolving rapidly with the help of
technology in an environment where data
is the new oil. In such a highly competitive
scenario, the report highlighted that

companies could not afford to overlook
any aspect of the shopper journey and
lag behind in the competitive market.
Consumer experience has become more
crucial today, and brands must constantly
innovate to offer novel products and
services to cater to modern consumers’
evolving demands. The report covered
the following aspects:

Engage for better connect: Personalised advertisements, proximity marketing, leveraging modern technologies
such as AR, VR, AI, chatbots, etc., are means through which brands—both offline and online—can engage with
their consumers.

Voice of consumer to be paramount: Listening to the consumers’ opinions, suggestions, and feedback is equally
important for offering them the most suitable products based on their needs. Social media sites, company websites,
blogs, emails, phone calls and texts, in-store communications, and other physical and online touch points should be
used for this—brands must be omni-present across mediums to listen and act upon the consumers’ needs.
Organise retail channels and trade to provide seamless and integrated solution: The retail market in India has
evolved from a “Bricks-versus-Clicks” to “Bricks-and-Clicks” and is now moving towards an “Intermix”. In future, the
most sustainable way for the brands to cater to consumers’ needs is to play across the confluence of multiple retail
modes—traditional stores, modern brick-and-mortar stores, online channels, etc.,—to offer a seamless shopping
experience.
Loyalty to be built by going the extra mile: There is a need to redefine the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for
loyalty measurement. In an environment where the consumers have a plethora of options and brands to choose from,
benchmarking loyalty through traditional parameters becomes highly challenging and not reflective in true sense. The
brands must go the extra mile to ensure that all its consumers have a memorable experience irrespective of whether
any products are bought or not.
Vouch for commitment: Consumers now actively gauge a brand’s commitment to its values and promises. They have
become more conscious than before regarding the sustainability practices of brands and the impact of these practices
on the environment. Hence, there is a growing need for public institutions and brands to collaborate and collectively
ensure sustainable measures as a standard norm in their operational practices.
Enhance product and service offering: While brands must use technology to engage with consumers more, there
is also a need to enhance the shopping experience of the consumers through hyper-personalised offerings, bespoke
marketing and loyalty solutions, agile and lean business models, etc. Another major trend is need for the vernacular
content to cater to the consumers’ needs—many brands are now catering to the demands of both urban and nonconsumers by offering their services in non-English regional languages.

KONNECTED to consumer (2017)
This edition of the report explored the
connectedness of consumers—the
main aspect being that the internet
and technology are driving the interconnectedness of consumers amongst

themselves and with brands. It is critical
for brands to be “connected” to their
consumers/shoppers to win them. The
report covered the following areas:

K

Knowledge of consumer data and insights
“Big” data generated via digital/online and through technologies used by brands in myriad forms and ways to make the
consumer retail journey and experience better. The knowledge from this valuable consumer data will help brands in
customised targeting, personalised offerings, and to have a more “meaningful” dialogue with their consumers.

O

Omni-channel approach unlocking the prospects
The infusion of offline and online retail modes has led to the emergence of omnichannel retail, where the shoppers may
browse online and buy offline or vice versa. This has led to the shifting of major brands into both pure-play offline and
pure-play online mode or a mix of both.

N

National policies impelling business growth and benefitting consumers
Conducive policies have led to increased investments that not only help the country grow monetarily, but also assist in
building infrastructure, bringing modern technologies, creating substantial social and environmental impact, etc.

N

Novelty attracting the new-age shoppers
While affordability and convenience remain the most crucial factors to influence a consumer’s purchase decision, novelty
or uniqueness in the offering also drives the sales. Novel approach by the brands to offer benefits via digital means also
helps brands in connecting with their consumers and building loyalty.

E

Environment and social practices driving sustainability and influencing consumer behaviour
Sustainable practices can help brands to stand out and build brand trust. Preference to sustainable practices such as
sustainable sourcing, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, waste management, clean packaging, natural and healthy
food options, etc., is gaining traction.

C

Convenience bridging the gaps
The growing consumer needs are pushing companies to implement improvements to their last mile delivery to make it
easy for consumer and shoppers to access the products. This compelling need of convenience and wanting the product
“now” is giving rise to hyperlocal start-ups, which connect local buyers and stores to penetrate remote areas, etc.

T

Technology augmenting consumer experience
Factors such as improved digital infrastructure, greater use of smartphones, and increasing number of start-ups in

retail, especially with the evolved general trade.

E-wallets scaling up the payment ecosystem and handiness
Greater degree of convenience, increasing internet penetration, greater smartphone usage and government support
have led to the exponential growth of Unified Payment Instruments (UPI), especially m-wallets.

Digital marketing as growth engine
Advantages such as cost-effectiveness, consumer engagement, and personalised offerings are expected to drive the rapid
growth of digital marketing in India. Going forward, native marketing—a completely non-intrusive ad format—will be used
in India to make the ad experience of the consumers completely natural and in flow with their retail journey.

firm clients, our people, and sections of

behaviours, and fundamental sense of
purpose that underpin all that we do.
Globally, Deloitte has grown in scale and
diversity—more than 315,000 people in

services yet our shared culture remains
the same.
