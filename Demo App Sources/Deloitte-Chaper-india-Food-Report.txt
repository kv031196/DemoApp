Food is considered to be an inherent 
factor and a strong backbone of 
economic growth for any country. In 
India, the food industry is estimated to 
be USD 448 Bn in FY 16. This industry is 
growing at ~10% and contributes to 9-10% 
of manufacturing GDP in FY171. 

The diversity in Indian culture and 
changing needs of customers create 
further complexity in the food production 
and distribution system in the country. 
A number of changes are shaping the 
Indian food landscape with disruptions in 
business models of companies, in terms

of their interaction with consumers and 
responsiveness to their needs. While 
packaged food is the fastest growing 
segment posting a double digit growth 
yoy, currently only ~10% of agri-produce 
is being processed in India2.

is expected to witness a radical shift. 
The complete ecosystem is expected 
to evolve from being a linear model to 
a more complex dynamic chain with 
multiple inter-linkages enabled by 
technology interventions.

Government of India’s drive to augment 
processing levels through Make in India 
campaign; and Industry 4.0 playing a 
major role in elevating the manufacturing 
as well as supply chain landscape by 
usage of technologies including Internet

in India 

India is the 7th largest country3 with an 
area of 31.7 Mn square kms, the 2nd most 
populous country and the 2nd largest 
producer of food in the world3. The task of 
ensuring that the food produced reaches 
1.2 Bn Indians is complex and involves a 
number of stakeholders. About 210 Mn 
farmers and agriculture labourers4 
cultivate various crops which they harvest 
and sell in Agriculture Produce Market 
Committee (APMC) markets or ‘mandis’. 
There are 2,477 APMCs and 4,843 sub-
market yards5 regulated by the respective 
states in India. Multiple levels of value 
addition activites are undertaken on the 

agri-produce in a food processing plant, 
which in turn produces the packaged and 
processed food products. There were 
38,608 registered food processing units6 
in FY 15. Distribution in India involves 
serving a large fragmented base of kirana 
shops. There are ~14,000 organized retail 
outlets concentrated largely in urban 
areas. Unorganized retail consists of 12-14 
Mn7 stores spread over 5,000 towns and 
600,000 villages across India. The diversity 
in Indian culture and changing needs of 
customers creates further complexity 
in the food production and distribution 
system in the country.

Dairy and cereals constitute 40% of 
the food consumed in India. However, 
changing consumption pattern and 
health consciousness is driving growth 
in consumption of protein over 
carbohydrates in the country. Health 
consciousness has also moderated growth 

of carbonates in India with people shifting 
towards natural juices and low sugar 
beverages. Increasing influence of global 
cuisine and culture has led to emergence 
of niche segments like cold press juice, 
vitamin infused water, condiments like 
oregano etc. in the country.

chaging consumption pattern has led 
to growth of lifestyle diseases in India. 
Close to two thirds of the disease 
burden in India is due to lifestyle 
diseases with National Health Policy 
2017 for the first time recognizing the 
shift in epidemilogy of diseases. With 
30 Mn diabetes patients15, India is 
known as the diabetes capital of the 
world. India has 61 Mn patients15 
suffering from cardio-vascular 
diseases and recording an increase 
in number of people suffering 
from thyroid problems, obesity, 
hypertension etc.

Increase in awareness has led to 
people looking for prevention of 
these disease. People are increasingly 
looking for healthier alternatives in 
food to incorporate health in daily 
consumption.

Convenience 
Of the total population of India, 443 Mn 
people are Millenials and 393 Mn people 
are Generation Z16. A larger percentage 
of young population and growth in dual 
income households and nuclear families 
has led to changes in consumption pattern 
in the country. Long and stressful work 
hours, increasing travel time, need to 
socialize and high disposable income 
has created a need for convenient 
food options.

 •  Convenient Format 

People are increasingly looking at 
packaging to provide convenience. 
Eastern Spices recently launched idly 
dosa mix in a package which can be 
easily carried, used and stored in 
refrigerator without additional hassles 
of transferring into containers. Paper 
boat’s packaging is known to increase 
shelf life and also gives the feeling of 
squeezing pulp from a fruit

 •  On-the go consumption 

Mintel research states over half of 
Indian consumers who snack on dairy 
drinks do so for convenience. This need 
for on-the-go consumption has changed 
pack preferences:
 –  Sachets over bottlesEx: Rooh Afza
 –  Ready to drink formats over 

powdersEx: Nityam Churan, Pudin 
Hara

 –  Food delivered in disposable

 •  Convenient to Prepare/ Order 

Among all food categories the Ready To 
Cook/Ready To Eat and packaged food 
has grown at the fastest rate (CAGR of 
18-20%)17. The need for convenience 
has led led to growth of e-grocery and 
food delivery in India. Further, some 
companies have started providing food 
kits and semi-prepared food which is 
gaining popularity with urban women.

 •  Out of home consumption 

The food service segment is estimated 
to be USD 48 Bn growing at 10%19. 
Less time to prepare food at home, 
increasingly affordability and 
disposable income has led to growth 
of Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) and 
casual dining at CAGR of 22% between 
2013 and 2016.18

Digitally Active
Today’s dinner table looks quite different 
than it did 10 years ago- there is likely a 
smartphone next to the fork and a laptop 
or tablet on the dining table. Technology 
and its awareness among the consumers 
has changed how people buy, prepare, 
order, perceive and consume food. 

 •  Online grocery and packaged food 

shopping 
A significant change that we have seen 
in favour of online food shopping is that 
consumers are increasingly overcoming 
their biases against purchasing items 
without inspection and safety of online 
transactions. The e-FMCG market was 
estimated to be USD 600 Mn in 2016 
and is set to grow at 60% YoY to reach 
USD 960 Mn by the end of 201720. 
Many online giants like Amazon and 
Flipkart, have launched online grocery 
businesses in 2017.

 • Online food ordering and delivery 
Changing consumer lifestyle, young 
population and increasing disposable 
income have led to a demand for online 
food delivery players. These food 
delivery apps provide convenience 
of scanning menus, prices and peer 
reviews across the restaurant. Apart 
from the restaurants, many aggregators 
like Food Panda, Swiggy, Zomato, etc. 
and standalone kitchens like HolaChef, 
Frehmenu etc have ventured into online 
food delivery. Recognizing potential 
in this space, many global giants like 
Google and Uber have entered this 
space with Google Areo and UberEATS 
respectively. 

 •  Online payments 

Payment mechanisms like digital 
wallets and credit and debit cards have 
reduced the need of carrying cash. 
Increased confidence of consumers 
in security of these mechanisms have 
largely benifited online transactions 
of food items. Many apps like paytm, 
mobikwick, etc. have started giving 
offers and discounts on payments to 
selected restaurants..

 •  Social media, blogging, research and 

discussion forums 
Over 168 Mn social media users in India 
discuss and share ideas for multiple 
topics including reviews, suggestions, 
ratings, etc. on social media platforms. 

Social media websites and apps like 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, 
Pinterest, etc. are used to read and 
write reviews, find new places, find new 
brands of foods and experiment with new 
cuisines. An industry study suggested that 
almost 45% of restaurant-goers below the 
age of 28 years seek at least some review 
of the restaurant before visiting. More and 
more consumers are connecting with each 
other on apps like Zomato, Yelp, etc.

Make in India Initiative
Government has given priority sector 
status to food processing industry under 
the new manufacturing policy 2011 with 
the aim to improve processing levels from 
10% to 25% by 202521. Several initiatives 
have been undertaken to support the agri 
and food sector in India:

 •  Loans to food and agro based 

processing units and cold chains have 
been classified as priority sector 
lending

 •  100% FDI has been allowed in all 
processed food segment under 
automatic route leading to growth in 
FDI investments in food at 13% between 
FY 13 to FY 1722

 •  In Union Budget FY 18, government 
created a fund of USD 1.5 Bn for 
setting up Dairy processing units over 
three years

 •  Animal husbandry and 

slaughterhouses: Ministry of Food 
Processing Industries runs a scheme 
for modernisation of slaughterhouses 
under the Public Private Partnership 
mode involving local bodies through 
Build operate transger (BOT), build-
own-operate (BOO) or joint venture (JV) 
mode. 32 slaughterhouses have been 
approved under this scheme which 
aim to:
 –  Set- up new facilities and modernise 

the existing ones

 –  Improve productivity and utilisation 

of bones, skins etc

 –  Promote scientific and hygenic 

slaughtering along with effective 
waste management

 –  Facilitate better Chilling facility and 

retail cold chain management

 •  Farmer Produce Organisations 

(FPOs): Rising farmer distress and 
increased farmer debt has led to an 
increase in FPOs. FPOs are helping 
mobilize farmer groups at the village 

level to help strengthen farmer capacity 
and increase productivity. FPOs 
enable access to fair and remunerative 
markets by linking producer groups 
to marketing opportunities through 
market aggregators. FPOs also reduce 
supply chain complexity for processing 
companies as they don’t need to deal 
with large number of traders but one 
FPO. At present, there are about 350 
registered FPOs in India. Further, 
about 400 FPOs are under registration 
process and are expected to be active 
by 2019. A market study suggested 
increase in per hectare production 
of up to 10% in 2 years as a result of 
increase in FPOs23.

Rise of regional brands
There are several distinct culinary regions 
in India with tastes and spices preferences 
varying greatly between states and within 
states also. Packaged food brands have 
realised this varied taste and introduced 
products catering to these different tastes. 
Regional brands have exhibited agility in 
experimenting with new products and 
launching products to capture these 
regional palate preferences. 

It is estimated that the Indian snack 
market shall reach USD 5 Bn by 2020 
growing from the current USD 2 Bn. 
This growth is expected to be driven 
by regional snack companies like Balaji 
wafers, Prataap snacks, Bikaji foods and 
DFM foods. Crisil research estimates that 
the regional packaged food players could 
grow twice as fast as their multinational 
rivals by 2020.

Banking on more quantity per pack, 
smaller value packs and increased

an average, regional snack brands are

Examples of growing regional brands:

 •  Haldirams, a leading Indian snack 

company has become household name 
by catering to the Indian palate with 
products like “Aloo Bhujia” and “Bhujia 
Sev”. This has led MNC’s to launch 
Indian falvoured snacks, for e.g., Nestle 
launched Bengali Jhhaal, Super Chennai, 
Amritsari Achari and Mumbaiya Chatak 
flavours

 •  Paper Boat led the revival of packaged 

ethnic drinks which resulted in 
category leaders Dabur's Real and 
PepsiCo's Tropicana to also launch 
coconut water, jaljeera and mosambi 
beverages

Recognizing this change in consumer 
perception towards regional brands, many 
private equity funds have invested in 
domestic regional snacking companies.

 •  Sequoia Capital invested USD 30 

Mn in 2011 and USD 3 Mn in 201424 in 
Prataap Snacks, owner of Yellow 
Diamond snacks brand. Currently, 
the brand has presence in Madhya 
Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, 
Maharashtra and Rajasthan with the 
aim of becoming a national player. In 
line with their growth plans, they are 
also setting up a plant in Chennai to 
expand in South India 

 •  Lighthouse Funds invested less than 
USD 14 Mn in Bikaji Foods in 2014

 •  WestBridge Capital Partners picked up a 

25% stake in DFM Foods in 2016

Unorganised to Organised 
Need for seamless experience and better 
quality food are the two key drivers for 
people to chosebranded products over 
non-branded variants. This has impacted 
the industry in the following ways:

 •  Platform to shift from unorganized 

to organized 
Hyperlocal delivery models create a 
platform for unorganized players to 
play in the organized market through 
collaboration. Futher, Goods and 
Service Tax is driving a shift towards 
organized suppliers to gain benefits 
under the new regulations

 •  Emergence of private labels 

Modern retailers have introduced 
private labels which are priced lower 
than their branded counterparts. Price 
sensitive customers who preferred to 
buy non-branded products because of 
the price discount are now considering 
buying private labels, thus shifting to 
branded products without disturbing 
their household budgets. Future Group 
plans to launch a new product, brand 
or category every two weeks to grow 
share of private labels to about 70% of 
the store revenue

 •  Growth of food chains 

While unorganized food retail is 
growing at 7%25, standalone organized 
food chains are expected to grow at 
14% and chained food brands at 20% 
in India. BBQ Nation a large food chain, 
grew from 32 outlets26across 11 states 
and union territories in FY 13 to 81 
outlets covering 19 states and union 
terrirotes by June 2017

Products to Services
Historically, product companies 
introduced variants, new product 
categories and packaging to gain market 
share. However, we have seen that 
there is a growing trend of companies 
launching services to promote captive 
consumption, increasing share of 
wallet, creating synergies through 
ecosystem and hence increasing 
customer lifetime value. 

Diversification into services enables 
product oriented companies to bypass 
retailers and focus on securing consumer 
loyalty and capturing an increased share 
of their wallet. Multiple touchpoints 
with consumers through service models 
leads to a potentially improved and 
lasting relationship. It also provides an 
opportunity for companies to gain insights 
about their customer preferences and 
buying behaviour.

Coca Cola offers a rented self-serve 
restaurant soda dispenser with over 100 
flavors. The company uses data from 
sales to improve products. Sula started it’s

Industry 4.0 in Food Industry  | India Food ReportA sustainable 
supply chain

In the changing consumer landscape, 
the young consumers hold a significant 
purchasing share in the market. These 
consumers are relatively more responsible 
towards handling environment and social 
concerns. In order to support this, both 
international and domestic brands are 
progressively looking for sustainable 
products to gain business advantage.

The following concepts are gaining 
importance to promote a sustainable

It is an accounting framework with 
three parts: social, environmental 
(or ecological) and financial. Some 
organizations have adopted the 
TBL framework to evaluate their 
performance in a broader perspective 
to create greater business value.
Focusing on social and environmental 
responsibility is perceived to drive long 
term financial gains, improve brand 
value and consequently enhance 
shareholder value.

02.  Traceability 

A dynamic regulatory environment 
with stricter scrutiny on product quality 
is making it vital for companies to 
take note of how goods are flowing in 
the supply chain. The ability to verify 
the origin and location of products 
helps identify the source and point 
of contamination. This helps reduce 
costs, improved products sourcing and 
creates a transparent supply chain.
03.  Need to shift towards open source 

sustainability 
Increasing pressure on existing 
resources like land and water needed 
for agriculture creates a need to 
adopt a sustainable model in the food 
industry. Increasinglyconsumers have 
started to correlate sustainability 
with healthy food habits. With 
increasing connectivity and open trade, 
communities across the globe are 
becoming vulnerable to demand supply 
fluctuations. Linking highly connected 
market with resource efficient 
consumption is likely to increase 
international cooperation thereby 
creating a sustainable supply chain.

Industry 4.0 in Food Industry  | India Food ReportIndustry 4.0 in Food Industry  | India Food ReportRegulatory Trends
GST
Goods & Services Tax (GST) implemented by 
India is perceived to be one of the largest 
tax reforms in the world and has had a 
major impact on the food industry. 

 •  Unorganized to Organized: Companies 
can look at vendor rationalization and 
increase share of organized vendors in 
order to be able to claim tax benefits 
available under GST. 

 •  Easier Transportation: The removal 

of octroi and entry tax is likely to 
significantly reduce the time and hassle of 
transporting goods across State borders.

 •  Logistics Efficiency: GST implementation 

is expected to result in efficiencies in 
warehousing and logistics space, thereby 
reducing wastage in food industry. 
GST could reduce the logistics costs of 
companies producing non-bulk goods 
by as much as 20%27, according to an 
estimate by Crisil Ltd.

 •  Government of India (GoI) Support: The 
Ministry of Food Processing, GoI has set 
up a GST facilitation cell for queries in the 
sector. Recently, GST rates of pasta and 
noodles have been moved to 12% slab 
from 18%.

 •  Handling of 334 lakh MT agro-produce 

valuing at USD 16,019 Mn

 •  Benefit 20 lakh farmers through 

improvements in supply chain, value 
addition and food safety standards

It is an umbrella scheme for incorporating 
ongoing and new schemes:

 •  Mega Food Parks 

The aim of this scheme is to link agro-
processing clusters with key production 
centers and improve supply chain 
efficiencies. Mega Food Parks have 
a hub and spoke architecture with 
collection centers (CCs) and Primary 
Processing centers (PPCs) as spokes 
linked to a central processing center 
(CPC). CPC is an industrial park in an 
area of ~ 50 acres that has processing 
units of different business houses. 42 
projects have been taken-up of which 
8 have been made operational (For ex. 
Patanjali Food and Herbal park in 
Hardwar, Srini Food Park in Chittoor, 
North East Mega Food Park) including 
3 completed. A sum of USD 230 Mn has 
been allocated for the remaining 34 
through the duration of the scheme.29

 •  Integrated Cold Chain and Value

The aim of this scheme is to provide 
integrated cold chain and preservation 
infrastructure facilities, without any 
break, from the farm gate to the 
consumer. There is an allocation of 
USD 253 Mn and 101 projects have 
been approved across 20 states which 
is expected to add capacity of 2.76 lakh 
tonnes of cold/ controlled atmosphere/ 
frozen storage, 56 lakh litres per day 
of milk processing, 629 refrigerated/ 
insulated vehicles etc.

 • Creation / Expansion of Food 

Processing & Preservation Capacities 
The aim of this scheme is to set up new 
units and modernization/ expansion 
of existing units. Grants for 35% (50% 
in north-eastern states and difficult 
areas) of cost of plant & machinery and 
technical civil works, maximum of USD 
0.77 Mn is proposed to be provided to 
the promoters of qualifying projects.

 •  Infrastructure for Agro-processing 

Clusters 
This schemen aims to create modern 
infrastructure for food processing 
closer to production areas. There 
are 2 components of the scheme: 
Basic Infrastructure (roads, water 
supply, power supply etc.) and Core 
Infrastructure (sorting, grading, ware 
houses, cold storages etc.).

 • Creation of Backward and Forward 

Linkages 
The aim is to create effective backward 
& forward linkages for perishable 
agriculture and horticulture produce 
through setting up of primary processing 
centers/ collection centers, distribution 
hub and retail outlets at the front end.

 •  Food Safety and Quality Assurance 

Infrastructure

FSSAI regulations
Food Safety and Standards Authority 
of India (FSSAI) is an autonomous body 
established under the Food Safety 
and Standards Act, 2006 which is a 
consolidating statute related to food 
safety and regulation in India. FSSAI is 
responsible for protecting and promoting 
public health through the regulation 
and supervision of food safety. Over 
the last 2 years, FSSAI has strengthened 
the regulatory environment as well 
as improved the compliance of these 
regulations.

 •  December 2017, FSSAI to establish 
a self-regulation platform for food 
companies, retailers stocking packaged 
food and fast-food restaurant chains. 
The Responsible Food Companies 
Score (ReFoc Score) is proposed to be 
a publicly accessible online platform 
for companies to rate themselves 
against parameters such as compliance 
with regulations, nutritive content, 
dealing with consumer grievances, 
upstream and downstream supply chain 
capacity and promoting food safety in 
schools. 

 •  May 2017, FSSAI reported that milk 

adulteration in more in North India 
than South India - FSSAI developed 
testing kits to check quality of milk and 
is negotiating with investors for mass 
production and marketing of the kit           

 • March 2017, import of food items with 
balance shelf life of less than 60% 
was banned. This is expected to result 
in better quality products arriving in 
India        

 •  October 2016, new standards on 

fortification of food were released. 
This included increased regulation of 
fortified foods and Integrated Child 
Development Schemes to include 
fortified food           

 •  2015 - Impact of the Maggi ban on 

other companies as compliance levels 
increased – almost 20 popular brands 
including Ching's Secret, Top Ramen 
and Hindustan Unilever's Knorr were 
selling without requisite approvals from 
FSSAI when the Maggi ban happened. 
Hindustan Unilever voluntarily decided 
to recall its Knorr instant noodles 
from the market till such time as its 
application was approved by FSSAI

 •  2015, FSSAI banned Maggi over 

high lead content affecting sales of 
the entire noodles category. Tamil 
Nadu banned the sale of Wai Express 
Noodles, Reliance Select Instant 
Noodles and Smith & Jones chicken 
masala noodles

Industry 4.0 in Food Industry  | India Food ReportIndustry 4.0 in Food Industry  | India Food ReportImpact of 
Technology

“Industry 4.0” refers to the digitization of 
manufacturing and the increasing digital 
connectivity of product, process, and 
factory. It marks the rise of smart factories 
in which new manufacturing technologies 
allow for greater communication between 
machines, and machine-level processing of 
data allows them to adapt instantly to new 
production requirements. It also refers to 
the connecting of information systems and 
sharing of data across the supply chain 
to improve efficiency. Industry 4.0 offers 
opportunities for greater efficiencies 
in energy consumption, real-time yield 
optimization, and other processes that 
can be mined from the heaps of data it 
generates.

Food and drink manufacturers are likely 
to benefit from the implementation of 
Industry 4.0 more than most industries. 

 •  The interoperability of connecting the 
production facility with distributors 
implies the product gets to market 
more quickly. This enables for 
“freshness” to be maintained

 •  Interconnectedness of various 

components of the supply chain is likely 
to enable end-to-end traceability.

 •  Greater flexibility is likely to enable 

bespoke production for each customer 
and rapid adaption to changing product 
specifications

 •  The data mined will help predict 

consumer demand and benefit from 
increased efficiencies. This is expected 
to lead to a reduction in demand-supply 
mismatches

 •  Energy usage could also be monitored 

and optimised to new levels

Industry 4.0 in Food Industry  | India Food ReportIndustry 4.0 in Food Industry  | India Food ReportHowever, there are challenges with 
adoption of this revolution:

 •  IoT under development: The 

technology for linking manufacturing 
and supply chain is still under 
development. It requires collaboration 
and a high level of trust between 
diverse businesses at the production, 
processing, wholesale, and retail levels. 
Sharing that much information does 
not come naturally to companies. This 
kind of transparency also requires 
improvements in Internet security.

 •  Capital Costs: In addition, many food 
and beverage companies are using 
processing and packaging equipment 
that was installed well before the IoT 
became a reality with a significant 
capital overlay. Replacing it may not 
be an immediate possibility. This 
manufacturing equipment may have 
years of useful service remaining if 
companies are able to upgrade the 
electronics, the drives, and software.

 •  Skilled Workforce: Another concern 
for many manufacturers is finding 
the ideal labour force to run their 
transformed facilities. 

Digital Agriculture
Technology is expected to act as a great 
enabler in improving farm productivity 
and reducing losses through precision 
farming. Incorporating latest technology 
in agriculture is expected to increase 
farm productivity by as much as 70% by 
202530 as per a research by Beecham 
Research. Innovations in farm monitoring 
devices, forecasting tools, analytics etc. is 
expected to help farmers achieve target 
productivity goals. 

 •  Farm Monitoring Devices 

Using robotics for continuous 
monitoring of farmlands can 

substantially reduce reaction time to 
threats like pest attack, weed growth 
etc. Drones can help capture real time 
images and data to identify origin or 
spread of problems. Infrared images can 
help capture crop health. For Eg: plants 
with higher chlorophyll content look 
red in infrared. This also helps in taking 
selective actions for crisis management 
thereby limiting loss of crops

 •  Data Analysis 

Using effective farm management 
techniques to gather historical data on 
soil performance, moisture requirement 
etc. could help create strategies

 •  Advanced farm equipment  

Sensor fitted tractors and harvesters 
collect crucial data on soil and plant 
health. This information is likely to 
further flow into farm management 
systems which shall help analyze the 
data and provide effective insights. 
As per Machina Research, 225 Mn 
interconnected devices are expected to 
be used in agriculture across the globe 
by 202431

 •  Alternate Farming Techniques  

Though Aeroponics, Hydroponics, Soil-
less farming, Vertical farming etc. are 
being practiced in limited scale under 
controlled environment, it is believed to 
be the future of farming. With increasing 
pressure on resources like soil and 
water, innovation in alternate farming 
techniques is expected to ensure 
food security. Temperature controlled 
environment helps limit use of chemicals 
and grow seasonal crops throughout 
the year, thereby improving farmer 
remuneration and profitability. 

The flexibility provided by digital systems 
ensure that such tools and techniques 
could be used for both small scale and 
larger scale operations.

Panchgaon village in Manesar district in Haryana has launched a project to grow crops in a soil-less environment. The project, 
commissioned by the Haryana Department of Horticulture, uses coconut fibre instead of soil to grow crops. The fibre is treated 
with liquid nutrients in a controlled environment to limit use of fertilisers and pesticides. Also, use of LED lights can help crops 
synthesize in adverse conditions. The crops grown are sold through bulk buyers in Gurgaon and Delhi. The project involved an 
initial capital investment of USD 90,000 with an annual operating cost of USD 30,000. However, the cost is expected to reduce 
with increase in scale.

Blockchain in Food Supply Chain
Blockchain is a protocol for a digital 
ledger that enables proof of ownership 
and the transfer of ownership from one 
entity to another without using a trusted 
third party intermediary (like a bank). 
The value that is transferred could also 
move through an extended supply chain 
while ensuring that what occurs at each 
point in the chain could be chronologically 
recorded. Blockchain, an immutable 
shared network, provides each participant 
end-to-end visibility based on their 
level of permission. Each participant in 
a supply chain ecosystem can view the 
progress of goods through the supply 
chain, understanding where a container 
is in transit. They can also see the status 
of customs documents, or view bills of 
lading and other data. No one party can 
modify, delete or even append any record 
without the consensus from others on the 
network. This level of transparency helps 
reduce fraud and errors, reduce the time 
products spend in the transit and shipping 
process, improve inventory management 
and ultimately reduce waste and cost.

Key benefits of blockchain in the food 
supply chain include:

 •  Transparency: Digital tracking and 

storage of all product information at all 
stages of supply chain including:
 –  Farm origination data, growing / 

raising conditions

 –  Factory/processing data
 –  Batch numbers
 –  Expiration dates
 –  Storage temperatures and conditions
 –  Shipping data 

Register time, location, price, 
parties involved, and other relevant 
information can be updated each time 
an item changes ownership. Thus, 
no one party is able to manipulate 
ledger to their own benefit, thereby 
improving supply chain traceability. 
This strengthens safeguards related to 
food authenticity, thus avoiding food 
fraud. Consumer confidence increases 
because producers and other related 
parties are held accountable.

 •  Efficiency: Blockchain improves how 

food is tracked, transported, and 
sold by:
 –  Reducing inaccuracies caused by 

traditional paper tracking and manual 
inspection systems

 –  Enabling retailers to better manage 

product shelf-life

 –  Streamlining distribution process
 –  Cutting costs and reduces food waste: 
can be the difference between being 
able to identify a few tainted packages 
instead of removing the entire stock 
from hundreds of stores

 •  Food safety 

Blockchain could create huge progress 
in food safety - cutting costs and 
saving lives
 –  Fewer contamination incidents
 –  Faster detection of problems
 –  Recalls can be addressed more 

quickly: can be a difference of days 
and minutes in discovering why and 
when contamination occurred

Industry 4.0 in Food Industry  | India Food ReportIndustry 4.0 in Food Industry  | India Food ReportCoffee is the world’s second-most-traded commodity, after petroleum. According to estimates from the Fairtrade Foundation, 
~125 Mn people make a living growing coffee. Most of these farmers are smallholders whose families live on less than USD 2 a 
day. A Denver based company, Bext Holdings is using a combination of visual assaying and weighing (aka a mobile robot), and 
blockchain for this problem. It allows buyers of coffee to rapidly analyze the quality and weight of a farmer’s product in the field. 
The robot uses optical sorting to understand what percent of coffee cherries look perfect or spoiled in a batch. A batch, typically 
a 30-40 lb. bag, will get higher or lower marks, which are revealed to both buyers and farmers on the spot. They then negotiate a 
fair price through Bext360’s mobile app. The combination of a reliable tracing and blockchain technology allows the company to 
bring in complete transparency to the coffee supply chain, and other commodities like cocoa etc

Things (IoT) in Agriculture and Food 
Manufacturing
Growing IoT acceptance is likely to 
generate more consumer data, helping 
retailers and consumer companies to 
deliver more personalized experience to 
the next-gen shoppers. IoT primarily helps 
the brands in location-based marketing to 
target the tech-savvy population. By using 
IoT, the retailers are enhancing their ability 
to collect crucial insights, which is helping 
them to provide an exclusive shopping 
experience. According to the market 
sources, the number of IoT connected

The global predictive analytics market 
is likely to grow at a CAGR of 21% to 
reach ~USD 10 Bn in 202232. In India, 
e-commerce, retail and consumer 
companies are increasingly leveraging

to be the most preferred approach as 
compared to other techniques. The data 

approach helps retailers predict customer 
needs and consequently increase sales by 
offering personalized promotional offers

In 2016, Starbucks introduced a feature in the USA that uses the customer’s vicinity to receive orders and deliver at the most 
suitable store, thereby saving a lot of time and improving service delivery. Starbucks has seen an increased loyalty and repeat 
orders from customers using the “Mobile Order and Pay” app. Orders through this technology account for around 8% of 
Starbucks’ total U.S. transactions.

Dansk Supermarked Group (DSG) is a Denmark based mass-market retailer that serves up to 1.4 Mn store customers a day. 
DSG is using analytics to match its inventory needs to customer preferences, ensuring that there are no stock-outs yet no 
overstocking. It does so by predicting the types of food consumers will purchase by analysing recent sales data trends. The 
approach generates accurate and timely insights into each store’s overall shopping history. The point-of-sale transactions are 
rapidly analysed to deliver information-rich, actionable reports to key decision-makers throughout the company. Store managers 
can view in detail exactly what customers purchased the day before which helps the company make the best possible inventory 
stocking decisions. At the firm level, DSG has the insights it needs to plan for future growth, including opening additional stores, 
introducing a new convenience-store format, and pursuing promising e-commerce opportunities.
