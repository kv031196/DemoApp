Foreword
The past few months have been more intense than any in recent memory. As of this
writing, COVID-19 remains an unresolved public-health challenge—causing tragic loss
of life and serious threats to the physical and mental well-being of people everywhere,
as well as immense economic damage. In addition, shocking incidents in the United
States have shone a spotlight on racial bias and social injustice, and have led to a reset
in values in many parts of the world.
For consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) and retail companies, the impact of these
world-shaking events hasn’t been uniform. Some companies have been among the
hardest hit, suffering massive sales declines and laying off thousands of employees
during lockdowns, whereas other companies faced unprecedented spikes in demand
and had to rapidly expand their workforces. Meanwhile, trends have accelerated at a
pace that, until recently, was unimaginable; changes that otherwise might have taken a
decade instead happened in days. Digitization, online ordering and delivery, and remote
working became widespread practically overnight.
Throughout this difficult time, we have been working side by side with many of the
leading global institutions in the consumer sector. Their highest-priority topics have
shifted: in March, most companies focused primarily on protecting employees’ and
customers’ safety, managing cash, building resilience into the supply chain, and setting
up control towers and “nerve centers.” More recently, many companies have turned
their attention to return and recovery. Business leaders are now thinking about
long-term strategic moves, particularly as the “next normal” looks dramatically different
than the future they had been planning for at the start of 2020.
Retailers and consumer goods manufacturers have the enormous responsibility—
and opportunity—to reinvent themselves and reimagine their next normal. We have
been continually inspired by the passion, speed, innovation, and sense of purpose that
we’ve seen across various subsectors and regions. We believe, more than ever, that
companies can and should learn from each other as they navigate an uncharted future.
We hope this collection of articles will serve as a guide in that journey. This
compendium contains our latest thinking on the topics that matter most to retail and
CPG leaders. It also features perspectives from respected business leaders Nick
Vlahos, CEO of The Honest Company; Hubert Joly, executive chairman of Best Buy;
and Daniel Zhang, chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

Consumer behavior and the business environment are changing fast—and it’s critical
for companies to keep a pulse on both. In addition to the pieces in this collection, we
have published numerous consumer surveys, industry-focused reports, articles, and
interviews since the pandemic began, and we will continue to do so. We are committed
to remaining a trusted and valued partner to retailers and CPG manufacturers as the
next normal unfolds.
Last, but not least, we want to thank the many consumer sector enthusiasts who
made this compendium happen. Let us thank the many guest authors who made this
reading so inspiring as well as all our 80+ authors who shared leading-edge thinking
from across the world on all different facets of the consumer world. A special thanks
also goes to Tobias Wachinger and Daniel Zipser for their thought leadership as senior
members of the editorial board and to Julia Büntig, our core project manager.

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
July 2020.

Consumer behaviors are settling into a new
normal, as people everywhere learn to live with
the reality of COVID-19 and as more countries
reopen parts of their economies. Although the
pandemic’s impact has varied across regions, five
themes have become evident among consumers
across the globe:
— Shift to value and essentials

— Health and “caring” economy
— Homebody economy
While these themes hold true across the 45
countries we have tracked through the crisis (see
sidebar, “About our surveys”), the following exhibits
focus on a subset of 12 core countries, selected
because of their economic significance and the
impact that COVID-19 has had on their populations.

— Flight to digital and omnichannel
— Shock to loyalty

We are tracking consumer sentiment over 45 countries.

About our surveys
Since mid-March, McKinsey has
conducted consumer surveys across
the globe to understand the impact
of COVID-19 on consumer sentiment
and stated behavior. The surveys,
now fielded in 45 countries, are
conducted online in local languages
on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly
basis, depending on the region. In
each country, results are sampled
and weighted for a representative
balance of the consuming class,
based on variables including age and
socioeconomic status.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

1. Shift to value and essentials
Even as some countries have reopened, many
consumers globally are continuing to see their
incomes fall. And they aren’t feeling too optimistic
about their countries’ economic outlook. In most

countries, confidence about economic recovery
has dipped slightly since early April. Consumers in
China and India remain more optimistic than their
counterparts in the rest of Asia, Europe, or the
United States (Exhibit 1).

With many people expecting COVID-19 to
negatively affect their finances as well as their
daily routines for at least another four months,

consumers are being mindful about their spending
and trading down to less expensive products
(Exhibit 2).

As consumers hunker down for a prolonged period
of financial uncertainty, they intend to continue
shifting their spending largely to essentials,
such as groceries and household supplies and
cutting back on most discretionary categories.
While purchase intent is increasing for a large
set of categories since we first measured it at the
end of March, outside China it remains weak in

10

discretionary categories such as apparel, footwear,
and consumer electronics (Exhibit 3).
Consumers in China, India, and Korea are reporting
positive spending intent in the next two weeks on a
broader range of categories, including household
supplies, personal-care products, nonfood child
products, and gasoline.

2. Flight to digital and omnichannel

United States, e-commerce continues to grow
across all product categories. In markets like China
with a high rate of online shopping before the
pandemic, although total consumer participation
in online shopping is not expected to go up
substantially, the share of wallet spent online is
expected to increase.

Most categories have seen more than 10 percent
growth in their online customer base during the
pandemic (Exhibit 4), and many consumers say
they plan to continue shopping online even when
brick-and-mortar stores reopen. In markets that
had moderate online conversion rates before the
pandemic, such as the United Kingdom and the

of these habits are seen as a work-around to the
crisis, many at-home solutions to regular activities
will likely be adopted for the long term.

3. Shock to loyalty
For certain products and brands, COVID-19 caused
supply-chain disruptions. And when consumers
couldn’t find their preferred product at their
preferred retailer, they changed their shopping
behavior: many consumers have tried a different
brand or shopped at a different retailer during
the crisis. Value, availability, and quality were the
main drivers for consumers trying a different
brand (Exhibit 5).

Our research shows that in China and the
United States, 75 percent or more of consumers
reported trying a new shopping method, while in
Japan, where lockdowns weren’t imposed, the
comparative number is only 33 percent. We expect
these changes will shape consumers’ habits even
beyond the effects of COVID-19. In China and
the United States, at least 65 percent of
consumers who tried a new behavior plan to stick
with it postcrisis.

Top 3 reasons for shopping a new brand²

4. Health and ‘caring’ economy
Across countries, survey respondents say that
when deciding where to shop, they look for retailers
with visible safety measures such as enhanced
cleaning and physical barriers. In addition, they buy
more from companies and brands that have healthy
and hygienic packaging and demonstrate care and
concern for employees (Exhibit 6).

During these trying times, consumers have a
heightened awareness of how businesses interact
with stakeholders, local communities, and society
more broadly. The actions that businesses take
during this pandemic are likely to be remembered
long after COVID-19 has been conquered.

5. Homebody economy
In most countries, more than 70 percent of survey
respondents don’t yet feel comfortable resuming
their “normal” out-of-home activities. For more
than three-quarters of consumers who adjusted
their behaviors due to the health crisis, the easing
of government restrictions won’t be enough.
Instead, they’ll wait for guidance from medical

authorities, reassurance that safety measures
are in place, and the development of a COVID-19
vaccine and/or treatments.
Consumers do plan to resume some of their
out-of-home activities soon, and shopping is first
on the list. Large events and air travel, on the other
hand, are last on the list (Exhibit 7).

How COVID-19
is changing consumer
behavior—now and
forever
by Victor Fabius, Sajal Kohli, Sofia Moulvad Veranen, and Björn Timelin

As the world begins its slow pivot from managing
the COVID-19 crisis to recovery and the reopening
of economies, it’s clear that the period of lockdown
has had a profound impact on how people live.
The period of contagion, self-isolation, and
economic uncertainty will change the way consumers
behave, in some cases for years to come.
The new consumer behaviors span all areas of
life, from how we work to how we shop to how
we entertain ourselves. These rapid shifts
have important implications for retailers and
consumer-packaged-goods companies.
Many of the longer-term changes in consumer
behavior are still in flux, giving companies
an opportunity to help shape the next normal.

1. COVID-19 is transforming
consumer lives: we have
covered a ‘decade in days’
in adoption of digital
Three change forces: economic downturn,
preference shifts, and digital acceleration

2. Behavior changes are not linear,
and their stickiness will depend on
satisfaction with the new experiences
Ups and downs ahead of us
Stickiness = forced behavior x satisfaction
The jury is still out on
value-driven behaviors

3. The future is now: players
should prepare
Prepare for consumption declines or
trading down
Address footprint offer and shopping
experience for the new reality
Follow consumers in their new
decision journeys when marketing
and communicating

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

Anyone who has hosted a virtual game night or had
their third lunch this week delivered grasps how
profoundly the COVID-19 crisis has changed our
behavior. But will these changes stick? Our global
findings show five megatrends: flight to online,
shock to loyalty, need for hygiene transparency,
back to basics and value, and the rise of the
homebody economy.1
In this country-specific deep dive, we examine
key behavior trends and the corresponding
consumer segments in the United States.2

Flight to online

1. Digital shopping is here to stay
Physical distancing and stay-at-home orders
have forced whole consumer segments to shop
differently. A few months into COVID-19, consumer
shopping online has increased significantly across
many categories. Consumer intent to shop online
continues to increase, especially in essentials and
home-entertainment categories. What’s more,
these habits seem likely to stick as US consumers
report an intent to shop online even after the
COVID-19 crisis. Categories where expected growth
in online shoppers exceeds 35 percent include
essentials such as over-the-counter medicine,
groceries, household supplies, and personal-care
products. Even discretionary categories such
as skin care/makeup, apparel, and jewelry and
accessories show expected online customer growth
of more than 15 percent.
2. Millennials and high-income earners are in the
lead when it comes to shopping online
While the shift to online shopping has been near
universal across categories, high-income earners
and millennials are leading the way in shifting spend
online across both essential and nonessential
items. Generation X has experienced a similar online
shift, although not at the same scale as millennials.
Generation Z has concentrated its shift online
in particular categories: apparel and footwear,
at-home entertainment, and food takeout/delivery.

Shock to loyalty

3. Consumers are switching brands at
unprecedented rates
The crisis has prompted a surge of new activities,
with an astonishing 75 percent of US consumers
trying a new shopping behavior in response to
economic pressures, store closings, and changing
priorities. This general change in behavior has
also been reflected in a shattering of brand loyalties,
with 36 percent of consumers trying a new product
brand and 25 percent incorporating a new privatelabel brand. Of consumers who have tried different
brands, 73 percent intend to continue to incorporate
the new brands into their routine. Generation Z and
high earners are most prone to switching brands.
The beneficiaries of this shift include big, trusted
brands, which are seeing 50 percent growth during
the crisis, and private labels, which have outpaced
the retail market. Some 80 percent of customers
who started using a private brand during the
pandemic indicate they intend to continue using it
once the COVID-19 crisis is over.
4. Brands need to assure strong availability and
also convey value
Shoppers have cited a number of reasons for
switching brands, with availability (in-store and
online), convenience, and value leading the pack.
For marketers, this highlights the need to find out
when shoppers are migrating brands or retailers
and then to manage logistics to ensure product and
service availability. In China, which is further along
the recovery cycle than most countries, the increase
in promotional activity to cater to consumers’ focus
on value in apparel is expected to continue.

Need for hygiene transparency

5. US consumers are changing how they shop in
response to health and safety concerns
As Americans contemplate going back out to shop,
hygiene and hygiene transparency have emerged
as important sources of concern. It is becoming

increasingly important for stores and restaurants to
not only follow hygiene protocols (thorough cleaning
and masks for consumers and employees are top
priorities) but also to communicate effectively that
they are following those procedures.
US consumers have already started to change
their behavior in response to hygiene concerns.
Technologies that enhance hygiene, particularly

contactless activities such as food and grocery
delivery and curbside pickup, are taking off. There
is strong intent to continue contactless activities
across the United States. As an example, 79 percent
of consumers intend to continue or increase their
usage of self-checkout in retail after COVID19. Millennials and Generation Z are the widest
adopters of contactless activities.

Back to basics and value

6. Consumer shopping intent is focused on
essentials
Around 40 percent of US consumers have reduced
spending in general, and they expect to continue
to cut back on nonessentials specifically. This
reality reflects profound discomfort about the state
of the economy.
With overall consumer spending declining, intent
to spend in essential categories is increasing. Even
among those with higher incomes, we see that while

essentials show spending momentum, intent to buy
discretionary products still lags significantly. As the
worst of the crisis abates, we do see online spending
in nonessential categories such as apparel and
footwear starting to come back. This effect is
strongest among high-income earners, those in the
Northeast, and Gen Zers.
7. Consumers want value for their money—
especially in essential categories
Tied to the concern about the state of the economy
is an increasing consumer focus on value—

especially in essential categories. For example,
in shampoo on Amazon, value and mass products
have experienced the greatest increase in
share, with gains of two and five percentage points,
respectively. In comparison, premium shampoo
products have lost more than five points in volume.

Rise of the homebody economy

8. Americans are changing how they spend their
time at home
Americans are spending more of their at-home
time on domestic activities, media, and news.
Intent to eat more at home post-COVID-19 has
strengthened significantly over the past three
months. Usage of popular online entertainment
platforms has skyrocketed. (The popular video

game Fortnite recently hosted a concert that was
“attended” by 12.3 million users.3) Investment in
at-home fitness through equipment purchases and
online activity is growing. Consumers still expect to
spend more time on at-home activities, even in less
restricted geographies.

As retailers contemplate the changes in consumer
behavior, they will need to adjust their strategies and
execution to adapt to the new norms, including:
—

adjusting mix and spend to where the consumer
is now (go digital, ensure full coverage of
bottom-funnel marketing and demand capture,
think geo-by-geo)

What makes Asia–

Gen Zers in the Asia–Pacific region aren’t like their older siblings. Here is

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
June 2020.

Gen Zers (born 1996–2012) are coming of age.
By 2025, the group will make up a quarter of the
Asia–Pacific (APAC) region’s population—the same as
millennials (born 1980–1995). And as Gen Zers mature,
they will make and spend more money. Although
Gen Zers share many qualities with millennials, it’s
wrong to think of them simply as a younger version.
Generation Z has its own unique characteristics. For
one thing, unlike millennials, Gen Zers are entering
into adulthood during a global pandemic. Still, the
demographics are clear: by 2025, the two cohorts will
compose half of APAC consumers.

and Gen Xers (born 1965–1979). The survey asked
respondents about their general attitudes toward
brands, shopping, digital, and media, as well as
their outlook on the world. It also asked specific
questions about shopping habits and brands for
selected categories (Exhibit 1).

In an effort to understand the distinctive ways that
Gen Zers research, consider, purchase, and use
products, in the second half of 2019 McKinsey
surveyed more than 16,000 consumers in six
countries—Australia, China, Indonesia, Japan, South
Korea, and Thailand.1 Then we compared results
across three generations—Gen Zers, millennials,

Gen Zers in APAC: Five consumer trends

In this article, we describe the consumer trends that
are shaping the behavior of Gen Zers, the six broad
segments that describe them, and how companies
can reach them.

Obviously, there are massive differences among
the six surveyed countries in their population profile
(aging Japan versus more youthful Indonesia),
economics (Australia’s GDP per head is several
times that of Thailand), and history and culture. In
specific areas, China shows tendencies that set it

Xers (10 percent).
apart. Nevertheless, we were able to come to five
broad conclusions about APAC’s Gen Zers:
— They rely on social media but are thoughtful
about how they engage with it.
— They want it all—and are used to getting it.
— They prefer brands that show their personality
and uniqueness but that are also well known
enough to be recognized.
— They are greatly influenced in their brand
selection by video content.
— They want to be seen as environmentally
conscious, but they often don’t want to pay for
this.
They rely on social media but are thoughtful
about how they engage with it
Gen Xers, millennials, and Gen Zers are all
comfortable with the digital world and rely on it for
learning, shopping, and entertainment. Even in this
context, Gen Zers stand out, which makes sense:
they have never known a world without the internet
and have grown up with social media. Across APAC,
almost a third of Gen Zers spend six hours or longer
a day on their phones, a considerably higher share
than millennials (22 percent) and Gen Xers (10
percent). Indonesians stand out: the average Gen
Zer there spends 8.5 hours a day on the phone. In
most countries, Gen Zers spend roughly two hours
longer a day than Gen Xers and an hour more than
millennials on their phones; they also spend more
time on social media. That helps explain why 50

32

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

to 60 percent of the primary influence in brand
decisions for Generation Z comes from social media
and online sites.
However, Gen Zers are aware of the downsides of
constant connection. In four of the six countries
surveyed, they were more likely than millennials
or Gen Xers to say people spend too much time on
their phones and to believe that technology gets
in the way of social relationships (Exhibit 2). In this
regard, it’s interesting that Gen Zers trust family and
friends more than any other source—and more than
millennials or Gen Xers do. More than half of Gen
Zers surveyed—including 75 percent of Japanese
respondents—say they think people overshare, and
49 percent are concerned about the use of their
personal data.
Given those worries and Generation Z’s high digital
literacy, it isn’t surprising that many Gen Zers
actively manage their online identities. Of the Gen
Zers surveyed, 36 percent said they “carefully
curate” their online presence, compared with 31
percent of millennials and 24 percent of Gen Xers.
They want it all—and are used to getting it
Gen Zers like to research before they shop. They
are especially interested in finding deals. Gen Zers
are considerably more likely than millennials or
Gen Xers to say that they always, or almost always,
look for discounts. In Australia, 66 percent of Gen
Zers surveyed say they always look for discounts
before they buy, and in China, the share is 50
percent; that is ten percentage points higher than
millennial peers. Gen Zers also want the benefits
of personalization. Except in Japan and South
Korea, though, they are generally less willing than

most countries; 73 percent of both Gen Zers and
millennials in China agree with this statement.

Because Gen Zers are young and less likely to be
working full time, they generally have less money
to spend than older cohorts do; that may be behind
some of their deal-hunting behavior. But they aren’t
willing to sacrifice quality for price. The percentage
saying they would “prefer to buy higher-quality
products which will last a lifetime” differs little
between Generation Z and the other cohorts in

collaborations. In Australia, for example, 61
percent of Gen Zers surveyed consider brands
that collaborate with other trendy brands more
interesting; only 51 percent of millennials do. In short,
Gen Zers want more for less—making them, quite
literally, tough customers.

What makes Asia–Pacific’s Generation Z different?

They prefer brands that show their personality
and uniqueness but that are also well known
enough to be recognized
In brands, too, Gen Zers want it all. They are
significantly more likely than Gen Xers to say
they prefer brands that are popular with others—
40 percent of Gen Zers surveyed look for popular
brands, versus 34 percent of Gen Xers. In Japan,
51 percent of Gen Zers (compared with 31 percent
of Gen Xers) say they prefer brands that are
popular with others.
But Gen Zers are also more likely to say they
want “brands that set them apart”—about twice as
often as Gen Xers and 1.3 to 1.5 times more than
millennials across APAC do. To reach Generation
Z, then, won’t be easy. Brands will need to balance
achieving popularity through scale so that they are
widely recognized while also maintaining a sense

of relevance and distinctness that connects with
younger consumers.
They are greatly influenced in their brand
selection by video content
Gen Zers view significantly more video media on
platforms such as YouTube or TikTok than other
cohorts do. This influences how they choose brands
and products. Majorities of Gen Zers in all six
countries surveyed, and 70 percent overall, say they
learned about new brands via video-based social
media at least once a month. The overall shares of
millennials (58 percent) and Gen Xers (46 percent)
who say that are much lower. Video influences
Generation Z not only in brand awareness but also in
purchase decisions: in all six countries, Gen Zers are
more likely than other cohorts to cite video as a top
three influence (Exhibit 3).

Gen Zers

They want to be seen as environmentally
conscious, but they often don’t want to pay for this
Across APAC, Gen Zers say they care about
sustainable consumption. Just as much as millennials,
Gen Zers say they prefer environmentally friendly
products, organic foods, and ethical fashion. For
example, in China, 60 percent of Gen Zers and
millennials surveyed state that they are trying to
minimize the negative effects their eating habits
have on the environment; half of both cohorts say
they always look for locally sourced produce. In
Japan, those attitudes are particularly pronounced;
54 percent of Gen Zers say they always look for
clothes produced sustainably, and 46 percent prefer
to wear used clothing—much higher figures than for
millennials and Gen Xers.
Extending beyond environmental consciousness,
60 to 80 percent of Gen Zers surveyed think that

brands should be held to account for their actions.
But only in Australia are Gen Zers noticeably more
likely than their elders to say that they are willing
to pay more for environmentally responsible
products—39 percent for Gen Zers versus 28
percent for millennials and 16 percent for Gen Xers
(Exhibit 4).
When digging into the underlying motivations
for such attitudes, we found a strong correlation
between the aspiration for sustainable consumption
and the desire to be “on trend.” In addition, those
willing to pay more for green products also tended
to be more conscious of brands in general. This
suggests that buying and using environmentally
friendly products and having a green mindset are
associated with social status in the minds of
Gen Zers.

Six kinds of Generation Z consumers
To assume that all Gen Zers are one homogenous
cohort would be false. Through an analysis of the
survey results, we identified six segments that,
together, describe the Generation Z consumers in
APAC (Exhibit 5). Brands need to understand these
segments to develop products and services to meet
Generation Z’s needs.

them to be on trend. Gen Zers in APAC tend to prefer
buying online because it’s more efficient. They know
what they want, and they don’t invest extra effort in
finding the best deals, with 62 percent of Chinese
Gen Zers in this segment finding online to be the
best way to shop, and 45 percent loving to shop on
Taobao or Xianyu.
For businesses, brand-conscious followers are
critical resources. Not only are there a lot of them,
but they tend to be early adopters of new products,
services, and experiences. In Australia, a third of
brand-conscious followers surveyed enjoy trying
out products recommended by influencers, and 36
percent always follow brands they love on social
media. But they are a tough audience to keep.
While they like brands, they aren’t particularly loyal
to them: in Australia and China, brand-conscious
followers are the least brand loyal of all six
consumer segments.

Brand-conscious followers
Brand-conscious followers make up the largest
single segment (24 percent) of Gen Zers surveyed,
composing roughly a third of those cohorts in China
and Thailand and a quarter of them in Australia,
Indonesia, and Japan (South Korea is the outlier, at
only 14 percent). Brand-conscious followers love
brands of all kinds, and they follow trends closely,
but they don’t necessarily love shopping. In Japan,
half of that segment say they hate shopping for
clothes, but 57 percent also say it’s important for

Businesses should be aware that while
ethical confidents support sustainability in
principle, they won’t necessarily pay more
for it. In South Korea, only 32 percent
within the segment say they will.
Premium shopaholics
Premium shopaholics (22 percent of Gen Zers
surveyed) love to shop. They take time to research
and compare, mainly online, so that they can
also purchase spontaneously. In South Korea,
for example, half of the segment extensively
research prior to shopping; at the same time, 20
percent—more than any other segment—often
make spontaneous purchases. In China, 53
percent of premium shopaholics spontaneously
make decisions on what to buy based on
recommendations they receive as part of the
shopping journey. To get exactly what they want,
they are willing to pay a premium: two-thirds of
Japanese and 75 percent of Chinese premium
shopaholics want to trade up when they can afford to.
Additionally, premium shopaholics are conscious of
how their consumption plays a social role: they want
to fit in, but they also look for brands that help them
stand out among their peers. In China and Japan,
61 percent of the segment want to stand out, and
65 percent want brands that are popular with other
people. In Australia, it’s the segment least likely to
prefer smaller brands over well-known brands.
Finally, premium shopaholics are active in social
media. They are twice as likely as those in other
segments to say getting “likes” on social media is
important to them. In China, for example, 49 percent
of the segment say earning social-media likes is
important to them—compared with an average of 26
percent in other segments.
The cohort is an obvious target for high-end brands
because premium shopaholics are most likely to

What makes Asia–Pacific’s Generation Z different?

be willing to pay extra to get what they want. To get
their attention, brands need to provide a convincing
story of why a product or service deserves to cost
more. Small brands with limited awareness may
struggle with the segment because they don’t offer
the recognition that it desires.
Ethical ‘confidents’
As the segment name suggests, these Gen Zers
(20 percent of Gen Zers surveyed) prefer brands
that are environmentally responsible and socially
ethical. In Indonesia, 62 percent of the segment
prefer natural and organic products, and 76 percent
prefer to buy environmentally friendly brands—20
percentage points higher than in other segments.
In all APAC countries surveyed, the segment
constitutes a higher percentage of Gen Zers than of
Gen Xers or millennials.
The relationship of ethical confidents with
brands is fluid: they are open to trying newer and
smaller brands, and they value customization and
personalization. Compared with brand-conscious
followers and premium shopaholics, they spend less
time online and shop more in physical stores. They
are confident in their choices and don’t rely
on others.
Given the buzz around sustainable consumption
from consumers (as well as from regulators and
industries), this segment is likely to grow. But
businesses should be aware that while ethical
confidents support sustainability in principle, they
won’t necessarily pay more for it. In South Korea,
only 32 percent within the segment say they will.

37

Value researchers
Although not one of the larger segments (15 percent
of Gen Zers surveyed), value researchers are worth
getting to know because they have a high degree of
brand loyalty. For example, 80 percent of Japanese
value researchers always choose a brand they know
over a new product. This isn’t blind loyalty, however,
as only half stick with a brand. Always on the hunt
for the best deal, they prefer to research and buy
online, with 90 percent of Japanese Gen Zers and 81
percent of Indonesian Gen Zers always researching
before they buy.
Value researchers won’t pay more just to get a
higher-status brand. Because they are cautious,
they often stick with what they know. Capturing the
segment is about getting promotions and customerrelationship-management efforts right. For retailers,
the segment is a moving target that is difficult to
build a bond of loyalty with: value researchers will
shop in multiple stores to get the best deal for the
product they want.
Disengaged conformists
Disengaged conformists (8 percent of Gen Zers
surveyed) are passive: they just don’t care much
about consuming. They want to spend as little time
as possible shopping, and while they are happy to
use discounts, they won’t make an effort to find
them. Once they find something they like, however,
they tend to stick with it.
In Indonesia, 41 percent of disengaged conformists
believe that all brands are pretty much the same, 53
percent always choose a brand they know, and 47
percent mainly shop spontaneously—the highest of
all segments to do so. That may give major brands
an advantage, as brand familiarity will go far with
the segment. As disengaged conformists don’t go
looking for deals or new products, they need to be
approached with offers and product features that
speak to their needs in a targeted way. The cohort
is largest in Japan (15 percent) and smaller in China,
Indonesia, and Thailand.
Quality-conscious ‘independents’
These Gen Zers (11 percent of Gen Zers surveyed)
seek out quality, which is something that they judge

38

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

for themselves—and are willing to pay for. They don’t
see a brand name as a guarantee of high standards.
They prefer environmentally responsible and natural
or organic brands—but more because they view
those characteristics as identifiers of high quality
than because of trendiness or a sense of ethics. In
South Korea, only 26 percent of the segment always
chooses a brand over a new product—the secondlowest figure among the six segments.

Winning over Generation Z
We have identified five principles that companies
should keep in mind as they approach Gen Zers.
Relevance and speed are more important
than ever
A significant share of Gen Zers surveyed see a major
brand as a source of strength; they may associate
the brand with quality (for premium shopaholics)
or simply see it as an easy choice (for disengaged
conformists). Across the region, Gen Zers are 20
percent more likely to try out new brands and
products than millennials are, and they won’t be
loyal to brands that don’t deliver.
Gen Zers want brands to be personalized, be
customized, and help them be distinctive. Therefore,
brands can’t rest on history. To stay relevant in
the market, brands need to leverage their legacy
while investing in fast and continuous innovation—
perhaps through partnerships and collaborations—
running at the same speed as smaller and
newer brands.
The quality and price equation has to be just right
Generation Z’s high digital literacy and easy access
to information enable its members to pick and
choose to ensure that they are spending their
money on what they really want. In a world in which
most consumers research significantly before they
buy, being competitive in both quality and price is a
prerequisite to win the allegiance of Gen Zers.
Consumer companies need to understand which
features consumers are willing to pay for. The
markers of quality will be different in each segment
because the segment members’ values vary. For

example, premium shopaholics are willing to pay
more to get more; disengaged consumers aren’t. To
match quality expectations while keeping prices
competitive, companies will have to be more
stringent than ever in deciding which features to
keep and which to deemphasize.
Social-media marketing needs to pay more
attention to video
The role of video can’t be underestimated: Gen Zers
view significantly more video media on platforms
such as YouTube or TikTok than other cohorts
do. That influences how they choose brands
and products. Brands that speak to Generation
Z through informative, fun, and inspiring videos
therefore stand a better chance of being shared—
and thus cutting through the noise. Many brands
have grasped that idea already, but there are far
more misses than hits. Brands need to build their
social-media marketing capabilities, whether real
time or curated, to engage with consumers in a
different way.
The brands that are winning are more creative, more
authentic, and faster to market with their content.
Producing the right video requires different skills
than posting the right photo or the right tweet.
Marketing teams need to have immediate access
to production teams that can create a narrative and
can shoot movies that move people and compel
them to watch all the way through rather than
clicking the skip button.
Being green isn’t enough: Price and quality
also matter
To capture a bigger share of the Generation Z wallet,
sustainable products need to speak to quality as
well as environmental values—and to communicate
these attributes through a visually compelling story.

Many small and successful ethical brands stand
out by emphasizing their quality and story through
package design and by posting videos and articles
about how they came to develop their products.
Bigger brands that want to expand their sustainable
portfolios should do the same while ensuring that
they can back up those assertions. Greenwashing
won’t do.
Brands need to be locally relevant
Although there are significant similarities among
the markets surveyed, the game for brands should
be local. Consumers in the region are naturally
influenced by their distinct cultural attributes,
lifestyles, religions, and eating habits. In Japan, Gen
Zers are more likely to want to fit in rather than be
unique; in China, they rely on brands, in large part,
to define who they are; in Australia, they lean more
strongly toward environmental responsibility and
sustainability than older cohorts do. Brands need to
ensure that their value proposition and messaging
are tailored to the local context—and to the local
distribution of consumer segments.

To reach APAC’s Gen Zers, brands need to master
distinct and sometimes overlapping qualities.
They will also need to react to how the impact of
the COVID-19 crisis is changing the attitudes and
behaviors of Generation Z. Brands need to be
both agile and stable, regionally aware and locally
focused, environmentally sound and acutely price
conscious, social-media savvy and respectful
of privacy, and authentic and able to tell a
compelling story. So yes, it’s complicated, but as
Generation Z’s affluence and influence rises, it’s
well worth the effort.

Over the course of a 22-year career at Clorox,
Nick Vlahos managed a variety of product
categories, including laundry, food, water filtration,
bags and wraps, and personal care. Notably, he
led the transformation of natural-products brand
Burt’s Bees into a global success. That experience
prepared him to take on a new kind of challenge in
2017, when he left Clorox to become CEO of a much
smaller but rapidly growing disruptor in the babyproducts industry: The Honest Company, launched
in 2012 by actress and entrepreneur Jessica
Alba. Its promise of safe and effective products
resonated with new moms nationwide.
In an interview with McKinsey’s Greg Kelly, Vlahos
shared his thoughts on the changing consumer
and the future of Honest. The following are edited
excerpts. (The interview took place before the
COVID-19 crisis. For a July 2020 update, see the
sidebar, “Staying Honest amid a global pandemic.”)

When I first started in the business, you’d walk into
a store, and you might find a little section in the
corner that was organic or natural. Today, when you
walk into a store—say, Costco—every other pallet
in the food section is organic.
And now, consumers are becoming more educated
about not just what they’re putting in their body but
also what they’re putting on their body—what they
put on their skin, what they put on their children.
I’ve found that the overall growth rates of natural,
better-for-you, “clean” products are double the
growth rates of conventional products. Consumers
are spending their money on brands they believe
they can trust.
McKinsey: The Honest Company started as a
direct-to-consumer [DTC] brand online, but in
recent years—and especially since you came
on board—the company has been building its
omnichannel presence. Tell us about that evolution.

McKinsey: You rose up the ranks at a leading
consumer-goods company with a long history. Now, Nick Vlahos: Let me just say a little bit about
Jessica, because I think it’s an important part of our

with a $5 Target gift card for a car seat. The goal
isn’t just to get her to buy Honest diapers and
wipes—it’s really to create loyalty, bring added
value, and have her be excited about being part of
the Honest family. Ultimately, it’s about providing
Mary the hyperconvenient experience that best
suits her needs.
By rewarding her with a Target gift card, I’ve now
created an omnichannel experience for Mary so
that she’ll go to a Target store and purchase a
product. And by the way, since I have year-round
distribution at Target and an endcap dedicated
to Honest diapers, wipes, and personal-care
products, she might also buy an Honest product
while she’s at Target. So my point is, by giving the
consumer an experience that connects with how
she shops and by creating solution sets that meet

her needs, we start to create “stickiness” and
loyalty to our brand.
As a consumer-packaged-goods manufacturer,
you can choose to look at Target or Amazon as
a competitor because they sell products that
compete with your products. But I look at it this
way: if I can create the right level of demand and
interest in my product, then where I’m putting
the product—whether it’s Amazon or Target or
Walmart—becomes part of a consumer-oriented
solution set. Consumers—especially Gen Zers
and the younger groups—have become channel
agnostic. What they’re interested in is accessibility,
ease, convenience: being able to procure a product
where and when they want to procure it. They don’t
think in terms of channels.

Staying Honest amid a global pandemic
In July 2020, more than three months after
Honest employees began working from
home, Nick Vlahos offered these additional
perspectives.
McKinsey: What shifts in consumer
behavior have you seen as a result of
the COVID-19 crisis? How is Honest
responding to these shifts?
Nick Vlahos: We’re constantly listening
and responding to the wants and needs
of our customers. Even through the
pandemic, our internal labs have continued
to innovate and to narrow their focus on
product developments that respond to
new consumer lifestyles. In fact, this year,
we will be introducing 50 new products,
several of which are in response to COVID19 and are focused on sanitization. Looking
to the future, we will double down on
innovation, focusing on the importance of
omnichannel and accessibility—two keys

to our success both prior to and during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
McKinsey: How has COVID-19 changed
the way you work?
Nick Vlahos: During this time, the safety,
health, and well-being of our Honest
family—employees as well as customers—
have been of the utmost importance to
us. Due to our omnichannel strategy,
throughout the COVID-19 crisis we’ve been
able to get our products to consumers.
We’ve been able to ensure that supply of
our essential products—like diapers and
baby wipes—remained strong.
On March 13, all our employees began
working remotely. Connectivity and
constant communication have been key
to our success in this new operating
model. We’ve made it a point to be as
transparent as possible with our Honest

family by sending regular updates on the
status of our workspace via email, our
HR hotline, Slack, and our intranet, Inside
Honest. We’ve also been working with our
partner, Thrive Global, which specializes
in workplace wellness. Together, we
developed a customized training session on
Honest University to help our employees
navigate ambiguity, deal with stress, and
handle the impact of COVID-19 during this
difficult time.
As we can’t meet in person, we’re using
Honest University to host “Launch and
Learns” for our employees so they can
learn all about the new products we are
launching, including the marketing and
retail plans for those products. Our goal
for these training sessions is to help our
employees become true ambassadors of
Honest products.

McKinsey: It’s true that it’s no longer helpful for
consumer-packaged-goods [CPG] companies
to think of channels in terms of discrete shopper
occasions. Still, many CPG companies are
wrestling with pricing across customers. Did you
make any changes to the pricing philosophy and
architecture of Honest products when you started
selling through mass retailers?
Nick Vlahos: No. To succeed as an omnichannel
brand, you have to start with the right value
proposition for your product. What price can you
command every day for that product, how do you
drive accessibility based on where consumers want
to shop, and how can you make money doing that
day in and day out?
The issue for some CPG brands historically has
been that the value proposition is off—and if it’s off,
you have to rely on trade spending, and you have to
play a high–low operating game in the marketplace.
You then become disadvantaged quickly, based
on how the Amazon algorithm reads your pricing
or how Walmart is establishing pricing. You get

tangled into a channel discussion. And you start
creating different value propositions in different
places that the consumer may not be interested in
at all.
McKinsey: Honest has successfully expanded into
not only new channels but also new geographies:
you’re now in Europe. How do you decide which
markets to enter?
Nick Vlahos: It’s important to have the right
product profile to be able to quickly get into a
market. We did consumer research to understand
where the Honest brand can resonate—where
consumers are interested in better-for-you,
wellness-oriented products. Some folks might
say, “Well, Europe is further along than the United
States when it comes to that trend.” But if you look,
for example, at how many ingredients are banned
in the European Union, the number is about 1,300,
whereas Honest has about 3,000 ingredients that
we try to avoid—ingredients that are thought to be
harmful to people’s health or to the environment.
The fact that we have high standards for our

product formulations and our testing means we’re
able to play in these markets; we don’t have to
reformulate our product lineup.
Having the right strategic partner in every
geography is also important. In continental Europe,
we’ve partnered with Douglas, the largest retailer
in the beauty space, and with Boots in the United
Kingdom. We’ve done a lot of work with our partners
to localize our marketing plans. The product is
common in those geographies, but the marketing
elements—the social media, the influencers that
we’re working with—are all localized. Thanks
to our targeted, multilayered approach, we’re
strengthening existing consumer relationships
while forging new ones in new geographies.
McKinsey: What gets you most excited as you
think about where the brand can go?
Nick Vlahos: One thing that excites me is that we’re at
the forefront of another consumer trend: minimalism.
More consumers are becoming minimalists when
it comes to their beauty regimens: they’re not
interested in doing a ten-step process to “put their
face on” every day. They’re busy; they’re on the go.
Honest Beauty products align with that trend.
From a digital-marketing perspective, what gets me
pretty jazzed is creating the right level of content
and community and translating that into commerce.
For example, we’re giving consumers “snackable”
content—information in bite-size morsels and
pieces—about what they should expect during the
40 weeks of pregnancy. We found five different
women, with different backgrounds, different
geographies, different life experiences. And we
documented, over a 40-week time period, each of
their lives and what they were experiencing.
So if you’re pregnant and you like Kasey and her
story, you can go to Honest.com to see content
about her journey. How does she balance work
with pregnancy? What’s it like to plan a gender-

reveal party? What should I do during the nesting
period? That content has been really powerful for
us. It’s enabled us to create more of a community.
We can then connect with each of our customers
and offer each of them a solution set based on her
unique experience.
McKinsey: You’ve talked about what people put on
their bodies as well as in and around their bodies.
What will you offer your customers next? How far
do you think the brand can extend? Could you
imagine Honest food or Honest air purifiers?
Nick Vlahos: Over the past couple of years, we’ve
really focused on the on-your-body component. We
have a connection with the consumer, and we have
insights into what you’re putting on your baby’s
skin, so we started thinking about what you put on
your own skin and what you put on your family’s
skin. Going from baby products to beauty products
made sense. We’ve invested disproportionately
in the safety and performance of our products to
develop everlasting trust. We spend a lot of time
on our products so that we can consistently delight
consumers. And we’re innovating fast. In my former
job, I would say the innovation process was always
over a two-year horizon or so. At Honest, our
innovation process is six to 12 months.
As disruptors in the natural baby and beauty
categories, we are constantly listening and
responding to consumers’ wants and needs,
which will always be core to our evolution. For
adjacencies to work, there has to be connectivity
with consumers and their behavior. Can I start
talking about beauty from within and what you’re
putting in your body? Yes. Could I get into the food
business or the supplement business tomorrow?
Absolutely. But do I have the capability set to
deliver the margin accretion I’m looking to deliver
across my portfolio? No. That day will come, but for
now I’ll stay within my lane and build the brand with
the consumer at the core while focusing on the
performance of the product.

Leading with purpose and
humanity: A conversation
with Hubert Joly
Best Buy’s former chairman and CEO reflects on a business’s reason for being by
defining it around purpose and humanity, the link to competitive advantage, and
managing shareholders and stakeholders during a crisis and beyond.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

In a recent poll of customers’ reaction to
the COVID-19 crisis, more than 80 percent of
respondents said they would remember which
companies “did the right thing by their workers” in
dealing with safety measures or efforts to avoid
layoffs. Three-quarters said they wouldn’t forget
those businesses that took missteps “long after”
the crisis ends.1

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
May 2020.

This is familiar terrain for Hubert Joly. After joining
Best Buy as CEO in 2012, Joly engineered a
dramatic transformation of the ailing electronics
retailer and built a reputation over time as one of
the business world’s most visible advocates of
defining a business’s reason for being with social
purpose and people as a guiding star. Today, as
more and more executives grapple with the need to
incorporate the needs of all stakeholders into their
leadership choices, Joly’s experience reflects the
challenges and opportunities inherent in mobilizing
customers, vendors, and other stakeholders in
pursuit of what he calls “noble purpose.” In this
edited interview, Joly, a McKinsey alumnus, shares
his thinking with McKinsey’s Bruce Simpson about
personal purpose and managing the evolving
landscape of corporate purpose during COVID-19
and beyond.

Personal purpose
My individual, personal purpose is to try to make
a positive difference for people around me and
then to use the platform I have to make a positive
difference in the world. This is an evergreen
purpose, meaning, whether I’m the CEO of Best
Buy or starting my next chapter, it’s always true.
It stems from a reflection on what work is, because,
of course, work is a big part of our lives. You can
see work as a curse, as a punishment because
we sinned in paradise. I tend to see work as being
essential to our humanity and to our fulfillment,
part of our quest for meaning. It’s not something
you do so that you can do something else; it’s

1

something that’s essential to our lives. I think
it’s essential when we lead companies that we
recognize this for all of the people working at the
company—and that we can connect their individual
purpose with the purpose of the company.

Pursuing ‘noble purpose’
These days most companies, and most leaders,
believe in the importance of purpose, and there is
a broad-based realization that excessive focus on
profits is wrong. The question is often, “So where
do you start and how do you sequence?” The
logical part of our mind would have us start with
purpose, then derive the strategy: anchor it in
purpose, and transform the organization on
that basis.
My personal experience is different. When we
started the turnaround, I was very clear about my
philosophy, which was that profit is not the purpose.
Purpose is to contribute to the common good. But
we did not spend time in the first three years of the
turnaround on refining our purpose. We spent the
time saving a ship that was sinking, by addressing
key operational-performance drivers.
We also spent a lot of time—and I can see it very
clearly with hindsight—on making sure that the
soil of the company was fertile. Do you know
the parable of the sower? If the seeds fall on
stones, nothing is going to happen. You may have
perfect seeds, but they aren’t going to grow. So
a lot of our emphasis was on creating a joyous,
growth-oriented culture, and on creating a very
human environment where people felt that they
belonged, that it was a human organization, that we
emphasized individual development.
How do you define that noble purpose? I believe
you find it at the intersection of four circles: what
the world needs, what you are good at, how you
believe you can make a positive difference in the
world, and how you can make money.

“A lot of our emphasis was on creating
a joyous, growth-oriented culture, and
on creating a very human environment
where people felt that they belonged.”

So the sequence of steps is not always going to
be, “Start with purpose.” A lot of companies are
focused on that, but it may not be the best point
of attack. When you start working on defining
purpose, the danger is to make it too abstract,
too glossy.
No. It needs to be grounded in true customer
needs, and true demonstrated abilities to achieve
competitive advantage. Your dream, of course—but
also the ability to make money: something that’s
very real, tangible, and tightly connected to the
growth and profit engine of the company.
The danger of the fact that purpose is very much
en vogue, paradoxically, is to put too much emphasis,
too early, on it—as opposed to really finding the right
time and the right approach to go after it.
If the definition of purpose is too much for the
website, people say, “Well, that’s not my reality.” So
how do we make it real and how do we unleash that
human potential?

People first
At the end of the day, a company is a human
organization made of individuals working together
in pursuit of a goal. These individuals produce
value for all stakeholders. They are the source,
not simply a resource. In a turnaround, typically
people tell you, “Cut, cut, cut.” My approach to

50

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

turnarounds is essentially the opposite; it’s to
start with people. I spent my first week on the job
in a handful of stores, starting in the store in St.
Cloud, Minnesota, to listen to the front liners and
learn from them what was happening. That’s how
we decided to invest in the shopping experience
online and in the speed of delivery, to neutralize
the advantage of online players. We also invested
in the store experience, partnering with the world’s
foremost tech companies to develop stores within
our stores. On the cost side, we started by looking
at how we could attack nonsalary expenses. Head
count was a last resort—starting not with the front
liners but with the top of the house. In eight short
weeks in 2012, we constructed a plan that we
called “Renew Blue.” We co-created it, we didn’t go
for perfection, and then we got the bicycle going in
a turnaround, creating momentum and energy. (For
a detailed look at Best Buy’s transformation, listen
to “Transformation and resilience: An interview
with Best Buy’s executive chairman Hubert Joly,”
on Apple Podcasts.)

Shareholders as customers
When we presented our Renew Blue plan to our
investors, it had all of the stakeholders you have
to engage as you lead these turnarounds:
customers, employees, vendor partners,
community, and shareholders.

With the shareholders, our approach was very
simple. We shared with them, in November
2012, our diagnosis of our strengths and our
opportunities. We were very transparent. We gave
them the overall framework and our long-term
targets. I don’t think you impress shareholders
just by the words you use. It’s more around the
say–do ratio. So in the following quarters, we
really focused on doing what we had said we were
going to do, on reporting quarterly progress, on
showing them concrete opportunities, and on
demonstrating how we had gone after them. That
allowed us to build credibility; delivering quarterafter-quarter progress was very helpful.
Sometimes there is a debate: as a company, “Do we
need to focus on the short term or the long term?
And do shareholders force you to do crazy things
because of a short-term focus?” I think that’s a
wrong, an artificial, debate. I’m a big believer that
98 percent of the questions that are asked as
“either/or” are better answered as “and.” Of course,
you need to focus on the long term. And you need
to focus on the short term. I’ve also always found
that if you tell the investors, “Look, I’m going to
be investing in this area, and the payback is going
to look like this,” they’re very open to that. They
want you to create long-term value, so if you’re
logical and you follow through with a track record
of delivering results, they’re very open to this. Any
management team that relies on excuses related to
shareholders, is, I think, misdirected. In the end it is
about treating shareholders as customers.

Measuring purpose
These days most companies, and most leaders,
believe in the importance of purpose. And there
is a broad-based realization that an excessive
focus on profits is wrong. It’s of course the easiest
thing to measure. There are generally accepted
accounting principles [GAAP]. And at the end of
each month, you know what your profit is.
The problem is that if you focus too much on this
outcome you’re actually going to be tempted to
do the wrong thing. And, by the way, anybody

Leading with purpose and humanity: A conversation with Hubert Joly

who believes that your GAAP numbers, even your
non-GAAP numbers, are a good measure of the
economic value creation for a business, is wrong.
If you dig into it, accounting has never really been
designed as a way to represent economic value.
For example, you always write down goodwill, but
you never write it up. I think the key in leading
companies is to have a balanced scorecard, to have
KPIs [key performance indicators] that are focused
on customers, like a customer-satisfaction score or
revenue per customer; on employee engagement
and turnover; on vendors and how the relationship
with them is going; your impact on and reputation
in the community; and on financial performance.
So it’s a matter of managing this holistically. And
I think as proxy advisers or rating firms work on
measuring performance, I am encouraged by the
trend toward measuring an increasingly broad
range of dimensions. More can be done, though,
in particular in the area of evaluating executive
compensation. Proxy advisers focus their
evaluation on total shareholder returns over one
year, three years, five years. That seems to indicate
that profit is the only thing that matters. There is
increasing realization that having a purpose—a
long-term strategy, taking care of all of your
stakeholders, doing well by doing good—is the
right approach.
So we have a bit of a lag here. I think that over the
next several years there will need to continue to be
some work on that. There’s been some interesting
work by the SASB [Sustainability Accounting
Standards Board] and a few others. We’re not there
yet, but I think we have to continue to move forward
in that direction.

Customer purpose
When we did market research, we saw that
although many of us love technology, and there are
a lot of exciting new products and things that we
can do with technology, it’s complicated, and can
be confusing. We need help as customers.

51

“One of the diseases that exists in
the world is the notion of zero-sum
games. You lose, I win. I win, you lose.
That’s wrong.”

So the purpose of Best Buy, in relation to
customers, is not just to sell you a TV or a
computer—though we’ll gladly help you buy one.
But it goes beyond that. It’s about what we call
enriching lives through technology by addressing
key human needs. The reason people buy a
computer or a phone is not really for the product;
it’s for what it can do.
Focusing on underlying human needs unleashed
a lot of growth opportunities—such as our
strategy to help aging seniors live in their
homes independently, for longer, by putting
sensors in their home, under the bed, in the
bathroom, in the kitchen, or even on themselves
for full detection. Through remote monitoring
and artificial intelligence, we can help detect
whether something is going wrong and trigger an
intervention. That’s a real need, and note how the
strategy is not focused on the fact that we have
brick and mortar stores or that we are a retailer. It’s
based on addressing human needs.
Interestingly enough, we have a second purpose,
which is to help the world’s foremost tech
companies to commercialize the fruit of their
billions of dollars of R&D investment. It’s not about
“showrooming,” it’s about showcasing—helping
customers understand what can be done. And it’s
been a critical element of our journey, our purpose,
and our economic equation.

52

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

Vendors as partners
The way we dealt with our vendor partners,
Amazon or Apple and so forth, illustrates our
basic philosophy of leading with purpose and
humanity, by taking care of and working with all
of our stakeholders. You could see these vendors
as competitors, right? Amazon, in some ways, is
a competitor. Apple is an important vendor, but
it also has its own stores. What we decided was
to cooperate with them. One of the diseases that
exists in the world is the notion of zero-sum games.
You lose, I win. I win, you lose. That’s wrong.
With Amazon, we decided that they were a
developer and manufacturer of great technology
products that customers wanted. So of course we
were going to sell these products in our stores.
Amazon now has corners in our stores next to
Google—which is great for customers. They can
see the various opportunities available, and they
can understand what can be done with that.
We’ve even gone beyond that. One day—it was
April 2018—Amazon and Best Buy announced a
partnership where Amazon gave us the exclusive
rights to their Fire TV platform to embed that
platform into smart TVs. These smart TVs powered
by Fire TV are only available at Best Buy or by Best
Buy on Amazon.com. So it creates opportunities.
Similarly, Apple has its own stores, but the Apple
store within Best Buy is a way to expand access to

Apple’s products for more of its customers. So it’s a
case where the customers win, the vendor partner
wins, and we win as well.

Purposeful leadership
One thing I want to add is what this focus on
purpose and humanity means from a leadership standpoint.
The first thing is to be aware of what drives you as
a leader. Be clear about your purpose as a leader,
the purpose of the people around you, and how all
of this connects with the purpose of the company.
If you are driven by power, fame, glory, or money,
this is a danger zone. Your role as a leader also
is not to be the smartest person in the room and
to make sure that everybody around you knows
how smart you are. It’s to create an environment in
which others can be successful.
We need leaders who lead with all of their body
parts: their brain, their heart, their soul, and their
gut. Especially in a crisis like we have today with
COVID-19, using your instincts and your intuition is
also important. So use all of your body parts.
Perfection is very dangerous because you work
on a team, and on your team you have other
human beings. And guess what? They’re not
perfect. They’re making mistakes. Being able to
say, “My name is Hubert, and I need help,” is a good
exercise that creates a much better outcome.

On COVID-19
In this COVID-19 crisis in particular, I’ve seen a lot
of leaders being OK with saying, “All right, this is
what we know at this point, this is what we don’t
know, this is the work we’re doing to figure out the
answer”—but not feeling the need to have answers
to all of the questions and giving the impression
that no mistake is being made. In fact, I think any
leader knows that creating an environment in
which it’s OK to make mistakes is something that
makes complete sense. So beware the concept of
perfection. Embrace vulnerability.
For me, one lesson from this crisis is around how
we define performance. This is a time when our
performance as leaders is not defined by our share
price or earnings guidance. It will be measured
by how we treat employees, how we deal with
our customers and communities. Back in 1940,
Winston Churchill spoke about Britain’s finest hour.
This crisis can be our finest hour as leaders, but it
requires that we ask ourselves a few questions.
One is, are we taking the time, first, to take care
of ourselves? That means sometimes hitting the
pause button and being clear about how we want
to lead. The second question is, what actions are
we taking and what is driving them? I am inspired
by many great examples of companies taking care
of their employees, not laying them off but perhaps
putting them on furlough. In Europe, they have
put in measures that enable employees to stay on
payroll, with government subsidies. Employees
will help us move forward. I think this crisis will
accelerate the movement toward the necessary
refoundation of business and capitalism, around
purpose and humanity, and I want to be part of it.

tough decisions: An
interview with
Alibaba Group chairman

While visionary founder Jack Ma has provided
Alibaba Group’s most public presence during the
company’s journey from apartment start-up to global
e-commerce powerhouse, current chairman and
CEO Daniel Zhang can be credited with many of the
company’s game-changing successes. Nonetheless,
the pair present as opposites—Zhang, with calm
and collected cogitation, in the face of Ma’s restless
dynamism—a duality that drew attention when
Ma nominated Zhang last year to succeed him as
company chairman in September 2019.

This interview
first appeared on
McKinsey.com in
September 2019,
before the COVID-19
outbreak. Some facts
and figures were
updated in February
2020.

Zhang, known on Alibaba’s Hangzhou campus by a
nickname that translates to “the free and unfettered
one,” had hitherto eschewed the spotlight, but
his instinct for innovation proved instrumental in
Alibaba’s rise to become the world’s most valuable
e-commerce company in 2017. Among Zhang’s
initiatives is Alibaba’s annual 24-hour sales
promotion, known as the “11.11 Global Shopping
Festival,” or “Double 11” for short, which notched
gross merchandise volume of $38.4 billion in just
24 hours in 2019. Zhang was also at the forefront of
Alibaba’s drive to become a mobile-first business:
more than 90 percent of sales on Alibaba’s China
e-commerce sites are now made via mobile device.
More recently, the Shanghai native spearheaded the
launch of Freshippo (known as “Hema” in Chinese)
grocery stores, which combine a high-end, in-store
experience centered on fresh foods with rapid
e-commerce home delivery and a robot-staffed
restaurant option.1
In this interview, Zhang talks with McKinsey’s Daniel
Zipser about Alibaba’s approach to innovation,
the power of purpose at Alibaba, and how Zhang
balances analytics and instinct to guide his own
decision making and push himself to spot hidden
opportunities. The following is an edited version of
their conversation.
McKinsey: What strikes you as notable about
Chinese consumers, and how are they evolving?
Daniel Zhang: What we see from our digital
platforms is that they are very diverse. Because of
the internet, they know what’s popular—not only
in China but all around the world. They also have
strong beliefs. Generation Z, for example, doesn’t
1

believe only in so-called big brands; they prefer
unique things and new brands from their own
generation. That’s [a big part of] their lifestyle. The
other important thing is that they tend to spend
more. China is famous for being a high-savings-rate
society, but the younger generation are more willing
to improve their lifestyle through spending, and that
presents huge opportunities.
McKinsey: Speaking of consumer spending,
Double 11, the online shopping festival that happens
on November 11 each year, generated more than
$38 billion in gross merchandise volume in 2019.
What was your vision when you launched the event
back in 2009?
Daniel Zhang: Tmall [Tmall.com] is now the largest
online B2C business in the world, but at the
time, it was tiny compared with Taobao [Taobao
Marketplace]. So we wanted people to remember
us. The idea was to bring together all the merchants
on Tmall and create a common event where we
could work together to serve our mutual customers
with the best service, the best products. We never
dreamed it would become such a fantastic event
ten years later, and that really reflects the power
of ecosystems.
But if you ask me about the idea on day one, I have
to say it came from a sense of, “How can we make
people remember us?” and “How can we survive?”
From there, it came from trying new things. Going
forward, it will continue to be about innovation. We
will look to promote not only online sales but also
brick-and-mortar stores. Double 11 is a day focused
on consumers, and they seek online as well as
offline experiences. That’s a very obvious trend we
see and will pursue as we continue to make
Double 11 the best day of the year for consumers.
McKinsey: Say more about innovation and
technology at Alibaba—and, in particular, the role of
artificial intelligence [AI].
Daniel Zhang: We are always trying new things—
always innovating services and using technology
to give consumers new experiences. For example,
people in China are now largely used to the
convenience of mobile wallets, so we have pushed
to promote facial recognition as confirmation for

We had been working on AI for many years, but, to
be honest, we didn’t even realize what we were
doing was AI. We are a data-driven company. We
create value from the data generated by real activity
of users and merchants; we use data as fuel for our
marketplaces to help merchants better serve their
customers. That is our logic, and we have been
working on this for many years.
Technology and data empower our whole business—
not only on the sales side and marketplace side but
also in the back-end office, in customer service, in
every single area. This is how we work. So when

Daniel Zhang: Alibaba has been a mission- and
vision-driven company from day one. Jack Ma,
along with 17 other early cofounders, set a great
mission: to make it easy to do business anywhere.
Our mission drives our business strategy, which is
empowering our business partners.
Even though our business is always evolving, the
mission remains unchanged. For example, we are
not only helping big brands and retailers—we also
help small and medium businesses grow. We believe
small is beautiful; we want to help new businesses
and entrepreneurs be more successful. That’s
always been our philosophy. In this digital era, when
we talk about Alibaba’s future, we focus on helping
our business partners win through successful digital
transformation, rather than about how we can make
ourselves even stronger. When small businesses
can grow faster and grow healthier, it will benefit the
whole society.

“We believe small is beautiful; we want to help new businesses and entrepreneurs become more successful,” says
Daniel Zhang, shown here with McKinsey’s Daniel Zipser at Alibaba’s headquarters in Hangzhou, China.

As the Chinese economy transforms into a
consumption-driven economy, Alibaba has a huge
opportunity to understand consumers’ changing
needs. We help connect the whole world with China
to facilitate easy trading and access to the world’s
largest consumer market.
McKinsey: You are often described as reserved,
soft spoken, and detail oriented. How do you see
yourself as a leader, and how has your leadership
style evolved?
Daniel Zhang: I don’t think I’m a reserved
guy, actually. People may tag me based on my
background as an auditor, and I always say that
maybe I picked the wrong first job. Obviously,
though, that first job gave me a lot of opportunities
to learn the basic skills and have access to many
clients in different industries. I consider myself very
lucky to be engaged in the digital landscape and to
be part of such a fantastic company in Alibaba.
In terms of my leadership style, I’m very nice to
people. I tend to give people opportunities to try
their own ideas, but I’m very tough once a decision
has been made. Once I make up my mind, I want my

teams to go ahead and get concrete results. That’s
why people at Alibaba always say it’s very difficult to
deal with me in business meetings, because [in that
context] I am always trying to get to the substance of
the matter and drive people to make progress.
So my leadership style is that, yes, while I speak
softly, I always make the tough decisions. I think
the most important thing [for a leader] is to lead the
whole team forward. They need direction, and they
need clear guidance. Leaders have to make the
tough decisions, even if it may not be the perfect
decision. At the same time, I also try to learn from
our young people—the people born after 1990, 1995.
Learning about their lifestyle and preferences helps
give me a lot of new ideas and inspires innovation.
McKinsey: How much of your process for
making tough decisions is intuition compared with
data analysis?
Daniel Zhang: It’s a combination. Our advantage is
having huge amounts of data, and my team does a
fantastic job in providing me with daily analysis. But
as a leader, you have to see something which others
cannot, and often that comes down to focusing on
customer pain points.

Speak softly, make tough decisions: An interview with Alibaba Group chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang

About four years ago, I had the idea for the
Freshippo retail stores, which have since become
very popular. My original thinking was that
traditional e-commerce’s hub-and-spoke model
could not deliver fresh products on time and on
demand. It’s not like you can deliver fresh fish to a
customer’s home while she is still in the office. We
had to rearchitect the business model and address
that particular pain point, and that process led to the
origin of Freshippo.
Pain points mean opportunity. And that’s why, every
year, I do a self-evaluation process during Chinese
New Year. I ask myself, “How many new ideas, how
many new businesses did I initiate last year?” I
don’t focus my self-evaluation on the performance
of the existing businesses: this is about the new
opportunities. Today they may be new ideas—very
tiny, very small—but they may become much bigger
in the future. Maybe they will become a main
business for Alibaba.
McKinsey: Among those ideas, there will inevitably
be failures as well. How do you handle failure as a

leader, and how does Alibaba approach the topic as
an institution?
Daniel Zhang: We give our people a lot of space
to try new things. It means you have to accept
mistakes. The vast majority of innovations will result
in failure; you have to acknowledge that. But the key
is, can we learn from the failures?
For example, five or six years ago, we tried a new
thing. It was a digital social-messaging platform
called Laiwang. We started the business, invested
heavily, sent some of our best people, but it failed.
We didn’t create a new experience for consumers
that differentiated from what they could already get
in the market.
That experience served as a critical lesson that
informed our thinking when we created DingTalk,
a cloud-based, SaaS [software-as-a-service]based work-collaboration platform. The tool
is a direct result of Laiwang’s failure because
the team realized that people have too many
contacts on their social networks. Users wanted

“The experience of new things is not only fun, but it also makes you feel younger,” says Daniel Zhang.

an alternative messaging platform dedicated to
work relationships and communication. DingTalk’s
success is another example of a pain point
inspiring a new service. It’s an example of valuable
lessons we can harvest from failure.
McKinsey: What motivates you, personally,
as a leader? What drives you when you get up in
the morning?
Daniel Zhang: First, it’s about having fun. That’s
the most important thing. I work with many young
people in our line of business—the digital landscape
is a brand-new frontier for society—and the
experience of new things is not only fun, but it also
makes you feel younger. I always say to my friends,
to my team, that the key thing to ask yourself is, “Do
you still have curiosity about the world?” If you are
curious about the world, then you will find something
different, then you will find new opportunities, and
you will move ahead.

McKinsey: Finally, you’ve worked alongside
Alibaba founder Jack Ma for several years now.
What’s it like working with him, and what have you
learned as a result?
Daniel Zhang: We work very well together. Since
joining Alibaba in 2007, I’ve worked very closely with
him. While we have totally different personalities,
we complement each other well. Jack is a visionary.
He thinks about not only today and tomorrow but
five and ten years from now, and that is what makes
Alibaba different. I learned from him the importance
of looking at the big picture. You need to have
your feet planted on the ground and move forward
solidly, but you also need to be forward looking. We
look at opportunities not only for today but, more
importantly, opportunities for the next generation
and the coming decades.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

After 40 years of outperformance enabled
by a widely used five-part success model, the
global consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry
struggled to grow over the last decade. Why?
Because 12 disruptive trends have diluted the old
success model for growing mass brands. Now the
COVID-19 crisis is amplifying many of these trends,
triggering an industry imperative to change.

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
July 2020.

CPG players need to rethink their portfolio
priorities and ‘where to play’ choices to increase
their exposure to growing markets, channels, and
sub-categories. These shifts will necessitate more
dynamic resource allocation and greater use of
mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures to improve
portfolio composition.
CPG companies also need to adopt a new howto-win model that reinvents marketing to focus on
consumer relevance and builds new, largely digital
commercial capabilities to grow with growing
channels and markets, especially in emerging
Asia. CPGs need to enable these new commercial
capabilities with an evolved operating model that
prioritizes consumer closeness and local decisionmaking in key markets, as well as intelligent
productivity gains to fuel commercial investments.
Together, these shifts will help CPG players
establish a contemporized virtuous cycle to replace
the old model that worked so well for so long. The
new model will help CPGs get their evergreen
brands on the right side of the disruptive trends and
help their small brands scale faster, fueling the next
era of industry growth.

(GFC) of 2008–09—15 percent, topped only by the
materials industry.
CPG value creation model for Western brands
This success owed much to a five-part model that
fueled the growth of leading brands. Pioneered just
after World War II, the model has seen little change
since then. This model entails:
—

Mass-market brand building and product
innovation, generating stable growth and
gross margins typically 25 percent above
nonbranded competitors

—

Partnering closely with grocers and other
mass channels to gain broad distribution as the
grocers grew

—

Building brands and distribution in developing
markets as consumers became wealthier,
capitalizing on the top trend on the planet—
rising wealth—that accounted for 70 percent of
revenue growth in the CPG sector over the past
two decades (and will continue to do so for the
next decade)

—

Driving cost out of the operating model, often
through increased centralization of marketing,
among other functions

—

Using mergers and acquisitions to
consolidate markets and enable organic growth
post-acquisition.

The rise and fall of the traditional
CPG success model

This model created a virtuous cycle—strong
brand equity and broad distribution generated
higher margins that in turn allowed for more
brand equity investment. Scale provided a critical
competitive advantage.

The global CPG industry performed very well for
a very long time, building many of the world’s top
brands. The industry generated the second highest
total return to shareholders (TRS) across industries
in the 40 years before the global financial crisis

The struggle to find growth
However, over the last decade, industry
performance has faltered in terms of fundamentals
and stock market performance. Economic profit1

growth has nosedived. From 2000 to 2009,
economic profit grew 10.4 percent per year; from
2010 to 2019, it dropped to 3.2 percent per year.
Similarly, industry stock market performance
went from outperforming the S&P 500 by 7.2
percentage points per year from 2000 to 2009 to
underperforming by 2.8 percentage points per year
from 2010 to 2019.
In more recent years, some players began pulling
ahead of the pack in economic profit contribution.
But margin, not growth, drove almost all of this
improvement. In fact, for the top 30 CPG companies

in absolute economic profit growth, margin
expansion contributed twice as much as growth
to value creation (Exhibit 1). Many of these players
made major SG&A reductions emerging from the
GFC and have sustained them since then—by 3.3
percentage points of sales since 2010.
The central problem is large brands, which are
struggling to create unit growth. A closer look at
the US market before COVID-19 is revealing. From
2017 to 2019, large brands (more than $750 million
in revenue) in the US lost volume at the rate of 1.5
percent a year. At the same time, small brands grew

1.7 percent, and private label grew 4.3 percent.2
Zooming in on the large CPGs (more than $2.5 billion
in US revenue), we see that all of their organic volume
growth and almost 90 percent of their overall value
growth came from their small and medium-size
brands (less than $750 million in revenue), even
though those brands contributed only 42 percent of
2016 revenues. Small brands (less than $150 million
in revenue) especially outperformed: they contributed
50 percent of value growth, while contributing only
11 percent of 2016 revenues.
As a result, in recent years the leading brands
in each CPG category have generated only
25 percent of value growth in US Nielsen-covered
channels.3 Meanwhile, small and medium-size
brands captured 45 percent of growth, and
private-label products captured 30 percent. This
underperformance by leading brands varies by

category, with household care performing best, but
leading brands in all categories captured less than
their fair share of growth (Exhibit 2).
Industry performance mismatch with high
market expectations
The market expects CPG leaders to overcome
this growth challenge. We analyzed the valuations
of 155 listed CPG companies. Their December
2019 aggregate market cap—chosen to avoid
the distorting impact of COVID-19—suggests
that investors expect significant performance
improvements. Assuming constant margins, CPG
players need to achieve one to 1.5 percentage
points higher organic growth rates than they did
in the last decade to meet investor expectations.
Maintaining their recent growth rate of 2.6 percent
risks an approximately 25 percent reduction in
market cap (Exhibit 3).

Accelerating growth by ~40–60 percent is a tall
order. To stay healthy and relevant to consumers,
CPG companies must confront the challenge.

12 trends disrupting the
traditional model
Why has the old success model stopped generating
growth? Because 12 disruptive trends have battered
the model over the last decade. Now COVID-19 is
amplifying many of them (Exhibit 4).
Five of those trends are disrupting CPGs’ traditional
mass market brand-building. Digital media and
the ubiquity of digital data are transforming how
consumers learn about brands. Price sensitivity
is skyrocketing in importance in the wake of
COVID-19. In Western markets, what consumers
value is shifting, with younger consumers seeking
brands they see as special, different, and authentic.
About half of Western consumers across age

66

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

groups are prioritizing conscious eating and
living, preferring purpose-driven brands that
help them meet personal goals like reducing
meat consumption. Small brands are rushing in to
deliver on these brand values (although execution
challenges during the COVID-19 crisis have held
them back, growing at only their fair share, instead
of outgrowing large brands).
Four of the 12 trends are transforming selling
channels. E-marketplaces have experienced
meteoric growth of 17 percent over the last five
years, generating 65 percent of the growth among
the top 150 retailers across the globe (and across
all categories). E-marketplaces surged in grocery
categories during the COVID-19 crisis, with
Amazon’s grocery business growing 45 percent
in the US and 80 percent in the UK, according to
Slackline. Meanwhile, discounters are continuing
their steady rise, especially in Europe and some
developing markets. As a result, grocers are

squeezed and responding in ways that make
them increasingly challenge trading partners.
Now COVID-19 is driving foodservice market
contraction—a major challenge, particularly for
beverage players.
While developing markets will continue to account
for 70 percent of consumer goods growth, the mix
of geographies has shifted, with emerging Asia
generating far more growth than other developing
markets (representing about half of global private
consumption growth over the next 10 years). Local

competitors and digitization of the trade structure
are key dynamics in emerging Asia.
Of course, all trends vary by market. Averaging
can risk masking the intensity of trends in leading
countries— for example, China for digital sales,
South Korea for beauty regimen, and Germany
for price and value. We advocate monitoring lead
markets to see and seed the future in others.

Key facts

Mass-market brand
building and product
innovation

Digital ubiquity

• Digital (data, mobile, and the Internet of Things) has been
revolutionizing how consumers and brands learn about and
engage with each other
• Under stay-at-home mandates triggered by COVID-19, digital
engagement surged across all platforms

Importance of value

• After the GFC, consumer confidence did not rebound to
prerecession levels until 2011 in Germany, 2014 in the UK and
the US, and 2017 in China
• COVID-19 will likely trigger a much deeper recession than the
GFC. Currently, 65 percent of European consumers surveyed
said they were very or extremely concerned about the economy

The millennial and Gen-Z effect

• US Millennials are almost four times more likely than Baby
Boomers to avoid buying products from “the big food
companies” and almost six times more likely to find newer
brands “better or more innovative”1

Conscious eating and living

• Conscious eating and living are gaining traction, driven by three
consumer desires—reduce meat consumption, contribute to
sustainability, and accommodate dietary needs and preferences
• 50 percent of UK consumers across the economy are conscious
eaters, with 38 percent eating less meat, 30 percent factoring
sustainability into food choices, and 24 percent accommodating
a food intolerance or preference (with considerable overlaps)

The explosion of small brands

• Conscious eating is redefining what healthy means
• Small brands have seen high growth, growing four times faster
than large brands, 2018-2019, although they struggled with
availability and execution during the COVID-19 crisis
• Venture capitalists have provided $18 billion of funding to small
CPG brands in the past five years
• Large CPGs acquired small brands successfully in the last few
years, often accelerating their growth and helping them over
the $100 million scale barrier

Partnering closely with
grocers to gain broad
distribution

Meteoric rise of e-marketplaces

• E-marketplace/online-to-offline (O2O) giants have generated
65 percent of the top 150 global retailers’ growth, growing at
17 percent, 2014–2019, versus grocers’ 0.8 percent
• Three e-marketplace/O2O giants—Amazon, Alibaba Group,
and JD.com—account for almost all of the growth
• COVID-19 helped e-marketplace/O2O giants surge in grocery.
Amazon grew its grocery business 45 percent in the US and
80 percent in the UK, according to Slackline
• This disruption will accelerate as e-marketplace/O2O giants
increase their geographic reach and move into brick-and-mortar

Key facts

Steady rise of discounters

• ALDI and LIDL grew 6.7 and 7.1 percent, respectively, between
2013 and 2018
• Discounters typically grow to secure market share of
20 percent or more in each grocery market they enter

Mass-merchant squeeze

• The rise of the e-commerce giants and the discounters is
squeezing grocers and other omni-channel mass merchants
• Together, the 76 largest mass players saw revenue growth of
just 0.8 percent between 2014 and 2019
• This pressure is forcing mass merchants to become tougher
trading partners, including participating in buying alliances,
which accounted for 55 percent of retail value from
multinational CPGs in Europe in 2019 and are projected to
exceed 95 percent by 2025

Foodservice challenges

• The COVID-19 crisis is triggering foodservice consolidation
• The ongoing economic impact and increase in remote working
will further challenge foodservice

Building brands and
distribution in developing
markets

Battle for emerging Asia

• China, India, and emerging Asia–Pacific will generate more
than 50 percent of the world’s growth in real private consumption, between 2019 and 2029. Yet they account for only 20
percent of private consumption today
• Within a decade, 75 percent of Chinese households and
almost 60 percent of Indian households will be part of the
consuming class
• The growth rates of other developing markets have nearly
halved since 2009 so they will contribute only 12 percent of real
private consumption growth between 2019 and 2029
• The US remains a key market, generating 20 percent of global
growth (the bulk of the 35 percent developed market share
of growth)
• Channels in developing markets are evolving differently than
they did in the West, e.g. emerging Asia’s fragmented trade
is digitizing

Driving cost out of the
operating model

Pressure for profit from
activist investors

• Activists ran more than 110 campaigns per year against CPG
players between 2016 and 2019 increasing attention to SG&A
industry-wide
• Activist investors encouraged some short-sighted choices
from which the industry is still recovering

Using M&A to consolidate
markets and enable organic
growth post-acquisition

Rising competition for deals

• Competition for deals has sustained high EV/EBITDA multiples
in CPG of 10.1x–11.8x since 2013
• Despite the COVID-19 crisis, deal competition will increase
as large assets grow scarce and private equity firms sit on an
estimated $1.6 trillion in dry powder

Tough questions and strategic choices
Before the COVID-19 crisis, major CPG companies
were evolving toward a new model. They were
sharpening their execution of the old value creation
model, experimenting with ways to own the
explosion of small brands in their categories, and
pulling the lever of productivity more than ever to
meet investor expectations.
Then the pandemic hit. Grocery volumes surged
20 percent with pantry loading and then settled
at 5 to 10 percent, while restaurants remained
closed or tightly restricted. Through this period,
large CPG companies mobilized their supply chains
and concentrated on top lines, while small players
struggled to pivot. Further, 15 percent or more of
consumers changed their primary grocery store,
generating a shock to loyalty and lots of forced
trial. This has created a powerful opportunity for
brand leaders to get closer to the consumer, while
reasserting the benefits of scale in the supply chain
and key account relationships. But the crisis is
also accelerating consumer demand for value and
reliance on digital. All of this constitutes a call to
action for the industry.
CPG companies need to confront these challenges
by rethinking their “where to play” growth strategies
across categories and brands to get more exposure
to growing markets channels and brands. And
they need to shift much faster to a new ‘how to
win’ model that embraces digital marketing, sales,
and operations, creating a new virtuous cycle that
works for today’s consumers and trade. We outline
questions to ask and moves to consider below.
Portfolio and category strategies
For each of our category franchises, where is the
growth, and how well positioned are we to capture it
with our current mix of evergreen brands and small
brands, especially in the shadow of COVID-19?
How are consumers changing? How are channels
changing? How well-suited are our competitive
advantages to these changes? Therefore, where
should we play? In particular, should we participate
in the value segment or allow the “good enough”

70

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

portion of our categories to grow without us? And
do we need to divest any brands because they no
longer fit our growth requirements or our business
model? What capability improvements and what big
bets, including true business model change, could
unlock a new wave of growth for us?
Great portfolio and category strategies start with
two inputs: a privileged view of what is happening
with the consumer and the market and a deep
understanding of the company’s competitive
advantages. With these in hand, a company can
determine how well-suited its current evergreen
brands and small brands are to capturing growth
and therefore what strategic goals to set for them.
The company can then identify what new business
models, external partnerships, and M&A agendas
could generate exciting new growth.
Evergreen brand growth strategies
How relevant are our evergreen brands to growing
consumer segments, especially those under 35?
What will it take to get our evergreen brands on
the right side of consumer and channel trends and
accelerate their growth?
Many CPG companies have been renovating the
brand equity of their large brands, imbuing them
with more purpose, more originality, and more
relevance. This is the right place to start. Particularly
in the context of COVID-19, delivering on the brand’s
promise is necessary but not sufficient. Consumers,
especially younger consumers, want brands that
understand them and share their values. They also
want to know that the brand is virtuous on local
community contributions, equitable commerce, and
environmental performance. Trust and purpose
matter more than ever.
Of course, superior functional performance is also
essential for evergreen brands, and the bar keeps
rising as private-label contract manufacturers
mature. Evergreen brands must obsess over
their functional performance across all consumer
occasions, using innovation as needed to retain
leadership.

Getting evergreen brands on the right side of
marketing and sales trends is also vital. Marketing
must be tailored by audience, delivering relevant
messages through relevant channels in a granular
way, while the product line of the evergreen brand
remains appropriately streamlined. Evergreen
brands must also embrace high-growth sales
channels and retail formats, even when they
require a different commercial model than grocery.
Channel strategies will need to be even more
customized to each country and category trend.
For example, in Brazil, the cash-and-carry format
should prove resilient in the aftermath of the
COVID-19 crisis. In all cases, evergreen brands
must shape the execution of their categories in their
relevant channels.

premium. Major CPG companies are getting the
hang of it. Small US brands acquired by large CPGs
grew faster than other small brands, between 2018
and 2020. But many small brands struggle to get
over the $100 million barrier so acquiring the right
challenger brands is not easy. Would-be acquirers
should look for the three hallmarks of a truly
scalable proposition—longevity (fit with a growing
lifestyle or consumer mindset), breadth (a natural
direction for expansion into adjacent categories,
channels, geographies, or needs), and momentum
(loyalty that secures high returns through repeat
purchase or word of mouth).

Small brand growth strategies
What will it take to help our small brands achieve
scale rapidly? How can we make small brand
acquisitions successful?

Acquirers can scale a small brand over time by
guiding, intervening in, or integrating it, but they
must act at the right time and remember why small
brands often initially succeed on their own. On the
journey to scale, small brands need to win on their
proposition, be disciplined on commercial levers,
and build the backbone for scaling. The small
brand proposition is usually the “sparkle”—often
predicated on new, niche consumer insights or
a business model that big brands typically lack
the authenticity to offer. The scaling risk lies in
expanding beyond the core too early, before a small
brand has earned the right to offer the adjacency.

Driving the explosion of small in your categories
is an exciting prospect, offering the potential to
extend category leadership with concepts that
appeal to engaged niches and can command a

Successful stand-alone small brands are very
disciplined and very careful about spending. Small
brands usually market efficiently with the core
consumer in mind. As they grow, they leverage

Above all, evergreen brands must lead in consumer
closeness, to guard against small competitive
brands popping up in segments left unattended and
against retailers offering good enough alternatives
at lower prices.

The new model uses digital to move
away from mass marketing and sales
and toward targeted commercial
execution.

their community and loyalty to “export” the brand.
They also tend to focus on a key channel to deliver
and delight the core audience before expanding
distribution points to increase purchase frequency.
An acquirer can open the door to a few thoughtful
channel expansions, as well as guide the small
brand in pulling commercial levers (i.e., pricing and
promotional optimization) before scale takes hold,
keeping the brand efficient.
The supply chain and the operating model are often
a secondary focus for a small brand but essential
for scaling. An acquirer can provide supply chain
instruction or even integration support to help the
small brand build a strategic and responsive supply
chain. This is especially helpful in categories with
long lead times, highly regulated environments, or
fluctuating raw material costs.

The new model
To execute these category and brand growth
strategies, CPGs need to adopt a new model—a new
“how to win”—that looks quite different from the old

model. The new model continues to leverage scale
advantages in marketing spend, distribution, supply
chain, and back office but uses digital to move away
from mass marketing and sales and toward targeted
commercial execution. The new five-part model,
which requires building or strengthening 16 individual
capabilities, looks like this (Exhibit 5).
Relevance-led brand building, innovation,
and marketing
Relevance-led brand building is vital for both
evergreen brands and small brands. Most CPG
companies need to do much more to sharpen
their consumer targeting, enabled by new digital
media. This targeting needs to cross all touch
points and include personalized point-of-sale
marketing, which remains very underdeveloped
today. Insights from the vast amounts of data that
consumers create then need to loop back into
innovation priorities and results, maximizing the
brand’s relevance to micro-segments and microoccasions, while keeping the product line focused
on an efficient core.

Partnering with all growing channels and
embracing digital sales
While grocers will remain CPG companies’ most
important and strategic trading partners in most
markets, CPGs also need to ensure that they
achieve pervasive distribution of their evergreen
brands, which requires embracing many channels,
including e-marketplaces. Small brands need to
be present in their best-fit distribution channels.
Therefore, most CPGs need to strengthen four
digital-driven commercial capabilities.

Managing data for proprietary insights. CPG
manufacturers must become experts on retailers’
big data in order to keep their seat at the table.
They must demonstrate expertise in big data
analytics, insight generation, and ROI tracking of
investments, particularly for e-marketplaces since
these retailers often do not value traditional CPG
category management.

Precision revenue growth management (RGM).
Leading CPG players unlock the next growth
curve by linking the core levers of RGM—pricing,
assortment, promotion, and trade investment—to
the company’s occasion expansion and activation
strategy. Precision RGM is powered by advanced
analytics tools that automate key analyses at a very
granular level and enable simulation and foresight.

Building brands and distribution in
developing markets
Participating in developing markets of course
requires deep local consumer understanding.
Companies need to rebuild entrepreneurial,
dedicated local organizations that can execute
impactful global marketing campaigns in locally
relevant ways.

E-marketplace management. Maximizing
success on these platforms without triggering
cannibalization of more profitable sales requires
appropriate, tailored messaging and assortment
at the point of sale. CPGs need to build developer
teams that produce the necessary assets (pictures,
videos, and key words) and drive technical execution,
day in and day out. These teams need to be fully
integrated with the business and prioritized as a
critical capability required to maximize growth.

CPG companies also need to evolve their routes
to market as the trade changes. In emerging Asia,
e-marketplace and online-to-offline (O2O) giants
will continue to lead, while digital enablement of
the fragmented trade will strengthen that format,
leaving less room for Western-style modern trade.

Building omnichannel and D2C businesses.
CPGs need to excel at omnichannel category
management, setting the goal of overtrading
versus each retailer’s brick-and-mortar business,
particularly given the expected two to three
percentage point share gain that online will enjoy
in most markets post-crisis. Direct-to-consumer
(D2C) businesses are commercially viable for only
select CPG propositions—namely, those with an
average basket and purchase frequency high
enough to justify customer acquisition costs and
make per-order economics viable. Categories
like pet care and non-OTC consumer health offer
abundant opportunities. For other categories, D2C
propositions may still be worthwhile to acquire

proprietary consumer data and create a test-andlearn opportunity.

For CPG players, early adopters of digitalled route-to-market models will have a clear
advantage, both in shaping point-of-sale service
level expectations and in leveraging the power of
analytics. The value proposition to the fragmented
trade will be increasingly customized, enabled by
advanced recommendations on assortment and
pricing that require different back-end processes
in CPG commercial teams.
Evolving the operating model to excel at local
consumer closeness and productivity
Historically, some CPG companies went too far in
pursuing a global one-size-fits-all model and lost
ground to more locally relevant competitors. Going
forward, CPG players need to reinvest in local
talent and decision rights in priority growth markets
and use them as lead markets for understanding
consumers and channels in the region or sub-region.

73

The local GM should own the game plan for winning
in the market.
Companies at the forefront of implementing this
more unbundled operating model have, for example,
abandoned traditional paradigms of how to organize
for innovation. Instead of driving innovation out of
global R&D centers, they identify innovation needs
by local market, with employees at all tenures having
nomination rights. Then they form a cross-functional
team within days, fast-track funding, and, with
the help of global R&D capabilities pulled into the
process, develop a marketable product in weeks,
rather than years.
This operating model uses technology and digitizes
wherever possible, from automating standardized
tasks in HR, finance, and IT to supporting the
decision making of signature roles, such as
equipping brand managers with KPI cockpits and
consumer insights dashboards.
Great operating models are adept at promoting
change. We advocate establishing a high-profile,
institutionalized sprint process that identifies,
resources, and sponsors new capability-building
and other priorities across the business in shortburst cycles. One CPG company, for example,
identified mission-critical tasks in marketing and
organized cross-functional teams in six-week
sprints around each task. Coupled with senior
sponsorship and a “fast-track removal of barriers”
spirit, all the teams completed their tasks, which
otherwise might have taken years. Such success
makes it easy to rally the rest of the organization
around the coming change and create a pull, rather
than a push, transformation.
Operating models also need to unlock the next wave
of productivity. We see several opportunities.
Next-generation design and procurement.
Product design needs to get closer to what the
consumer values and reduce all other costs by
modularizing, tearing down, and benchmarking
every element in new designs. Even leading

74

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

CPG companies still lag behind industries like
automotive and medical products in embracing
design-to-value. Indirect procurement often
offers another substantial savings opportunity.
Most CPGs can achieve savings of three to seven
percentage points on their addressable direct and
indirect procurement base.
Intelligent supply chain. Today it is possible to
realize the aspiration of an intelligent supply chain in
which an integrated planning process takes relevant
data from the demand side and turns it into reality
on the supply side. Success requires harnessing
digital data throughout the value chain and using
it in an integrated, automated corporate planning
process. A major benefit of this shift is the ability
to move from monthly to more frequent sales and
operations-planning cycles that maximize sales,
while reducing obsolescence and working capital.
Tech overhaul. Tomorrow’s supply chain must
operate in real time and with insufficient
information to enable cost reduction, resilience,
flexibility, and traceability, especially postCOVID-19. Most mature CPG players need to
jettison their legacy IT set-up, taking a zero-based
approach and moving into a cloud scenario focused
on customer-driven processes built for machines
talking to each other, not humans emailing
Excel spreadsheets.
Back-office automation. In the past 20 years,
SG&A cost reductions came from doing the mess
for less, making operations cheaper but not better.
Now is the time to overhaul the processes built
for the ERP environment of the 1990s and use
emerging technologies like intelligent automation
and artificial intelligence to modernize the back
office, creating a service-oriented, low-touch/
low-code environment to democratize automation,
analytics, and artificial intelligence.
Agile budgeting and resource allocation. Our
research shows that top performers reallocate
2 to 3 percent of resources per year, removing
unproductive costs and channelling funds to priority

initiatives. The zero-based budgeting processes
that many CPG companies have implemented make
this ambitious goal more achievable than in the past.
Programmatic M&A&D
CPG companies have been using M&A&D
extensively to pivot their portfolios toward growth
and add capabilities rapidly. In the last decade,
leading CPGs players turned over their portfolios at
more than twice the rate of other large listed firms.4
The strongest CPG players will continue to develop
the skills of serial acquirers adept at acquiring both
small and large assets and at using M&A&D to
achieve visionary and strategic goals—redefining
categories, building platforms and ecosystems,
scaling quickly, and accessing technology and
data through partnerships. The most successful
players employ a programmatic M&A approach
focused on snapping up challengers, rather than
market consolidation or expansion into adjacencies
(8.3 percent total shareholder returns between
2013 and 2018, compared with 6.1 percent and
–7.8 percent, respectively).5 These players often
4

complement their M&A&D programs with incubators
or accelerators for small players, that, at their best,
leave ample time to fully understand the success
drivers of the brand and help the organization scale
the brand without overburdening it with inflexible
operating procedures.

After a period of disruption intensified by the
COVID-19 crisis, the CPG industry is entering
a new era. CPGs that prosper in the 2020s will
make where-to-play choices that strengthen their
portfolios and get their categories and brands on
the right side of the disruptive trends. They will
also adopt a new how-to-win model that focuses
on relevant consumer marketing and selling
across growing channels, and they will embrace an
operating model that prioritizes consumer closeness
and intelligent productivity gains to fuel commercial
investments. These shifts will help industry leaders
unlock growth with brands and business models,
old and new.

The COVID-19 pandemic is posing staggering
health and humanitarian challenges.1 As the crisis
evolves, companies must act on multiple fronts to
protect their employees, customers, supply chains,
and financial performance. Retail and consumergoods sectors have been particularly affected,
with frontline employees directly at risk and
companies struggling with demand that is either
rapidly evaporating or surging well past the
available supply.

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
May 2020.

These most trying of circumstances have forced
organizations to adapt quickly. In the process, many
have achieved what they had aspired but failed
to deliver for years. Decisions are made faster.
Innovation cycles have dropped from months to
days. Working remotely, previously a benefit offered
to a portion of workers at some companies, is now
an imperative for most employees. Companies are
putting a greater emphasis on employees’ physical
and mental health than ever before, and they’re
celebrating leadership capabilities that weren’t
considered critical before the crisis.
These shifts occurred out of necessity—and, without
thoughtful action, many of the recent changes
are likely to revert over time to more traditional
approaches. Leading companies will use this
moment as an opportunity to rethink and reset their
operating models for the future.

The seven shifts of the next normal
As companies reconsider and reconfigure their
operating models, they need to be sure to underpin
them with seven core practices that will define the
next normal2 (Exhibit 1).
1. Reset of operating model and rhythm based
on fewer (and bigger) priorities
In the past few weeks, we have seen a sharper
focus on top priorities, while less critical initiatives

1
2
3

have been paused or discontinued altogether.
A recent McKinsey survey of more than 100
executives at consumer organizations3 revealed a
desire for this sharpened prioritizing to continue
and permeate into the next normal. As the fightor-flight instincts triggered by the crisis relax,
companies will be tempted to return to more familiar
modes of employee engagement.
Sustaining the type of focus and strategic clarity
we see today will require deliberate process
changes and leadership commitment. The most
focused companies use a variety of practices
to align their organizations with a clear set of
priorities. One such practice is having disciplined
management meetings, including structuring
the executive-team calendar to explicitly
support strategic priorities. Organizations are
also establishing working norms that ensure the
management team’s time together is focused on
major decisions, avoiding tactical discussions and
leaving ample time to ensure team alignment with
company priorities.
Most companies also find that frequently—and
formally—revisiting strategic priorities, a necessity
during the COVID-19 crisis, is beneficial. This
review can take the form of quarterly executiveteam check-ins to assess existing initiatives and
to determine whether to accelerate, evolve, or
stop them or to address more structural elements,
such as shifting from a three-year strategicplanning process to a more dynamic resourceallocation model.
Finally, aligning with fewer (and bigger) priorities
may also enable an organization to reset
organizational and operating structures. Narrowing
down priorities can afford organizations a chance
to realign their business segments with the
top priorities, rather than with more traditional
category or geographic segments, by elevating

allow the senior leadership team to incorporate

reflect the new priorities: M&A, business building,
and transformation.
2. Comprehensive cost reset
To recapture pre-COVID-19 margins, many
consumer-facing organizations will need to
reset their cost structures (Exhibit 2). Disrupted
categories (for example, white goods and apparel)
are suffering, but even surge categories such as
grocery will be adversely affected in the longer
term because of shifting consumer sentiment
and models of consumer interaction, such as
curbside pickup.
Our preliminary impact assessment found that
retailers that don’t proactively adapt to changing

78

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

conditions could see their margins fall 200 to
400 basis points because of increased labor and
fulfillment costs. The short- to medium-term impact
of shifts in costs and revenues is equivalent to
20 to 30 percent of general and administrative
costs. This reduction doesn’t include the additional
investment necessary to build capabilities that will
enable growth.
The story for consumer-goods companies is
more nuanced; some categories have flourished
thanks to near-term stock-ups while other, more
discretionary consumer goods have been affected
adversely. Although the margin implications
will vary by subsector, the need to invest in new
and emerging capabilities, such as digital, data,
and analytics (DD&A), is universal. Focused
priorities and streamlined decision making
naturally create an opportunity to reset the
cost structure.

Cost resets are known commodities to most
established organizations, but the coronavirus
offers a twist on the traditional approach. Physical
footprints will change to accommodate people
coming back to work. Physical-distancing protocols
will likely need to be put in place, at least in the near
term, to make sure that employees feel safe. New
flexible work options will have immense HR and IT
implications. These and other changes will compel
companies to adapt their organizational structures
and operating models.
3. Significant resource distortion to mustwin capabilities
Many of the shifts in recent months represent
a substantial acceleration of consumer trends
that had already been in progress for some
time. For instance, online shopping is up by 20 to
70 percent since the pandemic began, and supply
chains are adapting rapidly. Store economics have
been strained for some time, and we expect store

footprints to continue to shrink. In the next normal,
many stores could become nodes in a retailer’s
supply chain.4 These stores could also increasingly
reflect the tastes of local consumers as they adapt
product, pricing, and promotions to each market.
Finally, the international spread of the coronavirus
has accelerated the premium on flexibility in supply
chains, including in partner terms and sourcing
(particularly nearshoring).
We have observed other shifts that are much newer
but likely to be similarly long lasting. For example,
the unprecedented focus on hygiene during the
crisis has prompted updated hygiene protocols
and a rise in single-use plastics and wipes. These
changes are having an impact on sustainability
and are forcing companies to innovate ecofriendly
alternatives. Physical-distancing protocols also
have prompted a rush to adopt contact-free
payment and fulfillment models: about 30 percent of
consumers intend to continue using self-checkouts

In the longer term, we will likely see two major
developments. First, a so-called talent-anywhere
strategy, with teams consisting of members
across locations, could become increasingly
common and allow employers to strengthen
capabilities in geographies where they have been
difficult to build. For example, we mapped the
population of data scientists across the United
States and found that nearly 70 percent of the
headquarters for the top 100 retailers and top 100
consumer-goods companies were more than
50 miles from the nine largest concentrations of
data scientists (Exhibit 4).

manager, and distribution coordinator), potentially
reducing the talent-recruitment burden for HR.
Last, the increased use of the gig economy for
specialized labor, such as designers, could reduce
the need for in-house niche expertise or large
centers of excellence. Many retailers, for example,
are rethinking their large in-house creative agencies.
5. Changed employee value proposition
The COVID-19 crisis has changed the employeremployee dynamic. Recent events focused both
parties on employee benefits (for example, health
insurance and sick leave), protective measures (such
as personal protective equipment), and the new
norm of remote working.

Second, to load-balance peaks and troughs, new
talent marketplaces will emerge across functions
to enable labor sharing by companies that don’t

protective equipment becomes table stakes
for many roles. Employees shocked by the high
and rising unemployment rate will look for
employers to provide opportunities for them to
retrain in a lost-cost, online way. Employees in
critical roles may be well positioned to demand
that the expanded benefits they were offered
during the crisis lockdown (for example, more
generous sick-leave policies and enhanced medical
benefits) be maintained.

and more focused decision making across consumer
organizations. In our survey, more than 80 percent of
executives said that decisions during the COVID-19
crisis are being made faster than before the crisis.
Respondents also revealed that major decisions,
such as closing stores or exiting a business unit,
are requiring far fewer meetings: almost two-thirds
require five meetings or fewer compared with onequarter before the crisis (Exhibit 5).

That said, these benefits and improved working
conditions come at a price—and most consumer
companies will be keeping a close eye on their sales,
general, and administrative costs over the coming
months, if not years. The acceleration to a more
flexible workforce may generate efficiencies that

this changed dynamic.

While the need for accelerated decision making is
obvious during this trying time, the ability to sustain
such speed is something that companies have
struggled with for years. In addition to determining
the right governance to continue to make decisions
at pace, companies must also establish the
infrastructure to communicate and implement them
in a thoughtful way.

We have also noted the emergence of expedited

that need to be made quickly and paying more
attention to those that matter most or need careful
handling. Some leading companies determine
the level of impact (positive or negative) at stake
and the frequency each decision is made (and
therefore the familiarity of the decision). With
this approach, organizations can delegate lowerimpact decisions, which often accelerates their
execution, and focus leadership time on the big
bets, which frequently require time-consuming,
cross-functional coordination.6
Another approach is to think about how to build a
minimal viable product (MVP) for different types
of decisions. Many companies have done this
throughout the crisis without even realizing that they
were doing it. Retailers have focused on MVPs for
store reopenings, and consumer-goods companies
have replanned and rebudgeted the year (which
normally takes weeks or months) in days.
Using both a decision framework and an MVP
mindset will help consumer organizations to sustain
the metabolic rate and speed of decision making
they have had during the crisis.
7. Heightened focus on leadership development
The crucible of COVID-19 is highlighting leaders
who are stepping up in new ways—as well as
revealing unexpected gaps in leadership. In these
extraordinary times, an intuitive leader may often
be more effective than a tenured one, since a
reliance on experience and traditional skills may be
insufficient. The best leaders can:
—

be empathetic—and open to empathy in return

—

shift their management style to enable instead
of “command and control”

6

7

—

demonstrate decisiveness amid uncertainty

—

be a role model of deliberate calm and
bounded optimism7

As companies restart and settle in to the
next normal, they should aim to create more
opportunities for leaders to make rapid, highstakes, and cross-functional decisions as part of
the normal operating model. Organizations should
identify individuals in their leadership pipeline who
may fall short in the next-normal operating model.
Should any succession plans be reconsidered in
light of COVID-19? How could leaders benefit from
peer-to-peer coaching?

Putting it all together
When all of these trends are viewed together, it’s
clear that this crisis has required, and will continue
to require, companies to make big and bold
changes. The recent pace and depth of change have
demonstrated what’s possible; companies will need
to continue to push beyond the way things have
been done in the past, but first they must cement
the positive changes they have made since the
onset of the pandemic.
By restructuring their organization to focus on the
newly created priorities, modernizing their operating
models to account for remote working and faster
decision making, and shifting routines and rituals
to bring value to shareholders, customers, and
employees, leading companies will find ways to
emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger than they
were before. Such opportunities do not present
themselves often, and organizational leaders need
to act now to prepare for the next normal–which,
before we know it, we’ll all be living in.

COVID-19 poses staggering health and
humanitarian challenges.1 In this rapidly evolving
crisis, companies must act on multiple fronts to
protect their employees, customers, supply chains,
and financial results. All consumer sectors will feel
the economic impact of COVID-19. This impact
is likely to reshape short- and long-term M&A
activity, as investors and organizations explore the
implications and reassess how best to shape their
business and deploy and/or shore up capital. To
understand how Consumer Goods M&A may evolve,
we draw on lessons from the global financial crisis
(GFC) of 2008–2009 and explore the impact of
trends in the consumer sector that COVID-19 has
created, accelerated, or reversed.

While recognizing the meaningful differences

see lessons from the GFC worth considering today.
Analysis of the GFC has shown that companies can
drive value creation through M&A during downturns
by pursuing active M&A programs (Exhibit 1).
Similarly, private equity funds that were more
acquisitive during the GFC outperformed their less
acquisitive peers.2
We evaluated Consumer Goods M&A activity from
2013-2018 in “The next wave of consumer M&A:
executing for value,” which took an “archetype”
view of deal activity during that five year period.3
We identified the three most common consumer
goods deal archetypes, based on a review of 1,040
acquisitions completed by 119 companies between
2013 and 2018 (Exhibit 2). Our analysis found that
companies focused on “snapping up challengers”

while companies that “bet on adjacencies” had the
lowest (0.4 percent), and companies that sought
to “expand the portfolio” landed in the middle

(3.3 percent). This was particularly true for those
companies that took a programmatic approachto
challenger acquisitions (that is, companies that did
≥1–2 small to medium deals per year and primarily
participated in “challenger deal” archetypes). Their
corporate performance exceeded the industry
substantially with 8.3 percent TSR.

as shifting to value brands and channels) and after

brands) influenced consumer-goods companies’

foods and lifestyles. This should continue to pique
interest in assets in this space and may accelerate
large manufacturers’ interest in smaller, more
“natural” food brands across categories.
The financial uncertainty associated with an
economic downturn is increasing consumer focus on
value, leading some consumers to switch to privatelabel or value-oriented products. As companies look
to protect category market share, they may consider
acquiring value brands that help insulate them from
a shift to private label.
This time of crisis has also led consumers to return
to big brands they know and trust. While large
consumer goods manufacturers represented ~50%
of sales in 2018, they accounted for only 16 percent
of growth in 2015–2018, that share of growth rose
to 39 percent in 2018–2019 and reached 55 percent
in the first three weeks of April 2020.⁵
This new strength will support large traditional
manufacturers’ pursuit of smaller brands that may
not enjoy such tailwinds as a result of the crisis.
Larger manufacturers may reassess their strategy
for slower-growing heritage brands. They may take
the opportunity to divest noncore heritage brands at
more attractive valuations or allocate investment to
foster innovation and growth of their heritage brands.
COVID-19’s demand shocks have increased the
importance of supply chain resilience as retailers
actively manage product availability. This challenge
has laid bare the shortcomings of smaller producers
that depend heavily on co-manufacturing. Large
producers may look to purchase smaller challenger
brands at lower valuations and/or shore up supply
control though additional vertical integration.
Increased e-commerce penetration and in-home
consumption likely will increase interest in
digital and last-mile delivery capabilities across
large manufacturers, leading large producers
to participate in emerging ecosystems and seek
acquisitions in data and analytics or last-mile delivery.

Evolution of Consumer Goods M&A
deal archetypes postcrisis
As companies continue to navigate the crisis in
the coming months, their focus on the health of
employees, customers, and consumers and on
financial resilience will remain paramount. After
addressing these core issues, their focus will shift to
emerging from the crisis stronger and to reimagining
their businesses. We expect today’s trends to
encourage companies to undertake a holistic
evaluation of their strategic ambitions, business
models, categories, and brands.
As part of this re-evaluation, some companies will
identify a role for M&A in their portfolios, which
may mean acquisitions to pursue inorganic growth
or divestitures to fuel growth elsewhere. M&A
decisions, as always, will be company-specific, as a
deal that’s right for one company (for example, buying
a challenger brand at a potentially lower multiple
than last year) may not be the right deal for another.
Financial stability, multiyear strategic direction,
product and brand portfolios, and pre-crisis positions
will all be important factors for companies to consider.
The key for companies will be to take the time
required to think about M&A strategy before rushing
into deals. Finding the right asset is preferable to
getting the wrong one at a lower cost than usual.
For consumer goods companies for which M&A
can jump-start a new journey or course-correct a
current one, we see multiple possibilities for each of
the deal archetypes to propel growth—as well as the
need in some cases for divestitures.
Expanding the portfolio. First and foremost, scale
will matter again. Across categories, retailers
will have more confidence in the supply chains
of larger manufacturers; big brands are again
winning consumers’ trust; and products from scaled
consumer goods companies will be more readily
available. While driven in part by COVID-19, the
re-emergence of household brand names and
growth in large manufacturers’ portfolios were
already happening before the crisis.6

have invested heavily in digital capabilities to close
some of the gaps with their smaller peers. These
dynamics will likely depress the valuations for many
challenger brands and provide an opportunity for
larger companies to build capabilities through
acquisitions and/or partnerships.

With the right timing, companies with healthy
balance sheets and debt ratios will find opportunities
to acquire long-desired assets at a discount.
Furthermore, deals to expand the portfolio are the
clearest winners in reducing per-unit costs across
the portfolio. Company executives will need to look
seriously at the value of increased resiliency and ask
how long the window of opportunity to shape their
portfolio, while realizing incremental value, will last.
Recent shifts in market sentiment demonstrate how
quickly opportunities can disappear.

The challenger-related M&A activity that we
expect to see will probably mix partnerships
and acquisitions. Some deals in this archetype
have proceeded through COVID-19 (for example,
Nestle Purina’s acquisition of Lily’s Kitchen,7
Puig’s acquisition of Charlotte Tilbury8), and
many of these smaller companies’ attributes that
attracted larger manufacturers in the first place
remain—leading digital engagement capabilities
and extremely loyal consumer bases (such as with
Glossier) or e-commerce-related go-to-market
advantages (such as with Pharmapacks). The shift to
e-commerce, greater reliance on digital marketing,
increased importance of ingredient transparency,
decline in the food-service channel, and the critical
role of last-mile delivery all suggest the need for
stronger digital connectivity between consumers
and manufacturers and emphasize the importance
of e-commerce capabilities.

Large manufacturers with some combination of
relatively low leverage, access to investmentgrade debt, and a cash-heavy balance sheet will
be particularly well positioned to capitalize on this
deal archetype. They will, however, likely need to
navigate increased scrutiny from shareholders on
the size of synergies that can be achieved.
Snapping up challengers and acquiring
capabilities. We believe that consumer trends will
encourage companies to use M&A to bolster their
capabilities and build their next normal business model.
While growth is likely to be tempered for some
challenger brands, the original premise that made
them attractive to large consumer goods companies
still holds—bringing larger companies new
capabilities, loyal fan bases, and innovative products.
The crisis has highlighted the structural
disadvantages that many challengers face. Heavily
co-manufactured supply chains mean less control
over shifting production in a crisis, and smaller
balance sheets highlight the cash-flow issues
associated with highly variable demand. Both can
cause retailers to prefer larger brands with greater
supply reliability. Furthermore, large manufacturers
7

Consumer goods companies will have to answer
several questions about building tomorrow’s
capabilities today. What downstream partnerships
can you forge that will give you an advantage
as e-commerce gains importance? What data,
analytics, and digital marketing capabilities should
you invest in and how? How can you boost your
e-commerce capabilities quickly? What distribution
or last-mile delivery investments should you make?
What should you bring in-house to better prepare
you to manage this new ecosystem?
Our past research indicates that a programmatic
approach to snapping up challengers and building
capabilities yields the best outcomes of the three
deal archetypes. We believe that consumer goods
companies at the forefront of acquiring and/or
partnering with disrupters will likewise win down
the line.

While scale is coming back, it has
changed. New types of scale in the
form of data, platforms, and advanced
analytics capabilities will provide a
competitive edge in the future.

Betting on adjacencies. This is the hardest
archetype for consistently extracting value, as these
deals generate the lowest median TSR. Postcrisis, we
expect most companies to hunker down and focus on
their core business. However, it is helpful to distinguish
between horizontal adjacencies (that is, primarily
diversifying into altogether different businesses or
categories) and vertical adjacencies (that is, making
acquisitions up or down the value chain).
Companies with the means and intent to pursue
a portfolio diversification strategy will find the
opportunity less expensive in a time of depressed
but varied valuations. The impact of COVID-19
and the lack of resiliency it has exposed in some
consumer sectors may increase the need for
diversification. In addition, the divergence in
valuations across sub-sectors may make equity
financing of some adjacent deals more attractive.
Consumer goods companies with heavily
co-manufactured supply chains may look to increase
long-term resiliency by integrating upstream with
critical suppliers. The crisis is highlighting the value of
direct control, and some reduction in efficiency may
prove an acceptable trade-off. Owning these assets
may also support longer-term strategies to satisfy

9

consumer preferences like sustainability. Some
suppliers may require a cash infusion or outright
purchase to survive.
The downstream disruptions caused by COVID-19
and shifts in channel consumption habits will require
consumer goods companies to think more broadly
about how they engage their downstream partners.
Partnerships with traditional retailers, food-service
companies, distributors, and online delivery
platforms (including logistics) likely will need to
evolve in line with long-term industry trends.
As companies look forward to the next normal
and reassess the role of M&A in their postcrisis
corporate strategies, several questions can help
them rethink their M&A strategies (Exhibit 3).
Private equity. As PE players shift from managing
their current portfolios in the crisis to looking for
investments, we expect the role of PE funds in
Consumer Goods M&A to evolve.9 The current
climate of uncertainty, state of the leveraged loan
markets, and more limited ability to realize synergies
(unless executing a buy-and-build approach) are
likely to make would-be financial investors approach
valuations cautiously.

Exhibit 3

However, the global PE industry has an estimated
$1.7 trillion in dry powder,10 and some players have
indicated that they see the current situation as an
opportunity to invest in traditionally inaccessible
companies and brands.11 Furthermore, those who
invested in consumer goods companies during the
GFC saw slightly higher median exit multiples than in
the prior or the following two years (Exhibit 4).
The financial impact of the COVID-19 crisis (for
example, depressed multiples, scarcity of capital),
coupled with the revival of large brands, provides
the right conditions for PE investors to play a
significant role in consumer goods deals, including
in carve-outs of noncore assets, an area that has
historically been of great interest to PE firms.

Divestitures. By and large, we expect most
consumer goods companies to weather the crisis
well. That said, some distressed companies will need
cash to secure business continuity and strengthen
their balance sheets, and many companies were
already conducting strategic reviews of their
portfolios before the crisis. COVID-19 provides fresh
impetus for portfolio review, as companies will be
able to compare how different brands performed
in a unique period of demand fluctuation and see
which brands did and did not benefit from increases
in category demand.
Some otherwise well-performing companies
will use this opportunity to carve out and sell
underperforming businesses, or businesses that

Exhibit 4

.

do not align with their portfolio strategies, to free
up cash and invest in growth. As the recession
loomed in 2008, the most resilient companies
divested underperforming businesses faster than
their peers and reduced debt by about one dollar for
every dollar of capital on their balance sheets, while
less resilient competitors added more than three
dollars of debt.12 TSR performance indicates that
shareholders reward companies that take an activist
mindset and use divestitures to dynamically manage
their portfolio. Analysis from 2007–2017 indicates
that companies that refreshed their revenue source
by 10 to 30 percent outperformed those that did not
on TSR by approximately four percentage points.13

Next steps for consumer goods
companies
COVID-19 and the onset of an economic slowdown
will likely reshape the landscape of consumer deals
and partnerships in the sector. We encourage
consumer goods companies to take three steps now
as they contemplate M&A and partnerships going
forward, all grounded in the three Cs of excellent
M&A strategy—competitive advantage, capacity
(financial and operational), and conviction.

competitive advantage lies. The first step in

for differentiation? In this context, how have your
competitive advantages changed, and what new
advantages have emerged? How can M&A and
partnerships accelerate your growth?
Assess your capacity to execute acquisitions and
partnerships. A realistic assessment of balance
sheet strength and your ability to make acquisitions
independently, as well as your ability to secure

financing in the postcrisis environment, will provide
the critical foundation for your M&A strategy.
Assessing the willingness of existing shareholders
to accept dilution for attractive equity deals will also
play a key role. Determining feasible acquisition
targets will lay the foundation for prioritizing
exploratory actions.

Build conviction with early exploratory actions
in the M&A market. Consumer goods companies
should generate data-supported perspectives on
market trajectory, next normal scenarios postcrisis,
and the risks of further disruption. Short-listing
top priorities and securing executive and Board
commitment to M&A will accelerate decision-making
as markets thaw and potential targets emerge.

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
May 2020.

The humanitarian cost of COVID-19 continues
to unfold across the globe, affecting lives and
livelihoods. Organizations are reassessing almost
every aspect of their operations, asking urgent
questions about how to allocate and deploy limited
resources amid extraordinary stresses.
As the crisis evolves, with uncertain timelines and
an unclear path to recovery, leaders are responding
on multiple fronts simultaneously—working to
safeguard their employees and customers and to
understand significant volatility in demand, supply,
and cost.
To support their businesses in the short term—
and, ultimately, enable a recovery in the long
term—organizations will need greater operational
and financial flexibility. That will mean looking for
opportunities both to preserve cash now and to be
ready to reinvest nimbly for the future.
This requirement is leading CFOs to rethink how they
can manage their sales, general, and administrative
(SG&A) activities to identify opportunities for
realigning spending in a rapidly changing business
environment. Within separate business functions,
leaders are also balancing the immediate need for
resources against the longer-term need to build
and maintain capabilities critical for a recovery, all
while ensuring that their spending aligns with their
corporate purpose and their many responsibilities to
employees, customers, and communities.
One business leader noted that the easy decisions,
such as those relating to travel and events, have
already been made (or taken out of businesses’
hands completely). By contrast, the majority
of spending choices involve harder trade-offs,
requiring new levels of visibility, governance, and
thoughtful discussion so that leaders can align on
priorities in making some of the most consequential
decisions they are likely to face.

Lessons from resilient leaders
In 2019, our colleagues demonstrated that
resilient companies—those that most successfully

The SG&A imperative in times of crisis

weathered the 2008 downturn—moved faster to
create balance-sheet flexibility than their peers,
and then accelerated faster as economic conditions
showed signs of recovery. They achieved three
times the improvement in operating expenses as
a percentage of revenue than their “nonresilient”
peers, and did so substantially earlier, “saving their
powder” and preserving capacity to invest in growth,
while keeping SG&A in line with sales as revenue fell.
Additionally, most companies classified as resilient
stand apart from peers on multiple financial and
operational metrics through both downturns and
recovery, including revenue and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
Building on experience from prior downturns, and
recognizing the unique characteristics of this
global crisis, we suggest a four-phase approach to
help organizations respond to COVID-19-related
shocks and the potential for prolonged economic
uncertainty across the SG&A spend base. By
utilizing some of the core principles of zero-based
productivity, the approach enables increased
spend visibility, enhances spend-management
mechanisms, and improves the links between
business strategy, financial forecasting, and
frontline spending.
The four phases correlate to the stages we expect
companies will follow as they find their paths to
the “next normal” (Exhibit 1). In “resolve,” companies
manage an immediate reduction in spend. In
building “resilience,” organizations enable better
spending choices by a deeper understanding of
trade-offs. The “return” phase shapes longer-term
reallocation and investment. Finally, “reimagine and
reform” builds on new capabilities and knowledge to
create a healthier long-term approach to SG&A.
Resolve: Preserve savings
At this writing, many cities, states, and entire
countries are currently under policies to shelter
in place or stay at home, with varying levels of
stringency. As a direct result, organizations are
seeing an immediate reduction in some areas of
spending due to lower activity levels from both
employees and customers.

Perhaps the most glaring example is travel spend,
which has become effectively zero for many
companies. Requirements for facilities maintenance
and utilities are falling almost as quickly, as
offices close and increasing numbers of people
work remotely.

between the demand drivers and the resulting
spend are not as straightforward. Instead, these
categories will require a more involved set of choices
about how to allocate resources—with a view not
only to the immediate crisis but also to enabling
longer-term changes as well.

By taking quick steps to increase spend visibility,
finance leaders can capture and preserve these
savings—perhaps to fund immediate needs such as
for new worker-safety measures—before they are
absorbed elsewhere in the organization.

In areas such as marketing, where return-oninvestment (ROI) models often exist, a data-driven
approach can inform decision making. For example,
some campaigns, tactics, and brands that are no
longer profitable will be easy to pause. Similarly,
for products where volatile demand is outstripping
available supply, uncommitted promotional spend
can be curtailed. ROI-driven marketing models
can also be used to reallocate investments across
channels and geographies as consumer sentiment
changes in specific markets.

Resilience: Understand short-term spending
trade-offs
A second set of spend categories within SG&A
functions will also be affected by the crisis, but
will not ebb on their own because the connections

96

During crisis

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

Most large organizations are seeing
major increases in demand for cloud
computing, videoconferencing, and
other remote-work technologies.

In the same fashion, investment in IT will likely
need to be readjusted to free up resources in line
with demand. Most large organizations are seeing
major increases in demand for cloud computing,
videoconferencing, and other remote-work
technologies. Additional support may also be
required for virtual selling channels as stores
remain closed or salespeople are unable to meet
with customers.
To sustain greater flexibility while making spending
choices, organizations will likely need a mechanism
for challenging spending requests—including those
that are usually preapproved—based on a rigorous,
ROI-focused process. These practices will reveal
fast opportunities to implement shifts in strategy
and policy as the crisis continues to unfold.
One organization recently launched a centralized
spend-management team across its wide and
distributed network of manufacturing sites. At
each location, representatives from finance and
procurement serve as spend challengers whose
task is to question proposed allocations to make
sure that each one has a thoughtful supporting ROI
case. After remote training, the challengers now join
daily videoconference sessions to review purchase
requests across all indirect-spend categories.
Purchase orders are approved, deferred, or denied
based on rationale and criticality, freeing up
resources almost immediately.

The SG&A imperative in times of crisis

Through a similar process, organizations can
challenge service levels across SG&A functions,
embracing a zero-based approach by linking
requests to essential requirements rather than the
previous budget allocation.
Return: Make long-term resource-allocation
choices in recovery
As the weeks and months progress, a recovery will
ultimately appear on the horizon. Organizations will
start to move beyond day-to-day crisis management,
creating an opening to focus on decisions about
how to reallocate resources to support recovery.
One executive recently said, “Coming out of this, I
want to put resources where they should be, rather
than where they have always been.”
The strategic implications from longer-term
application of zero-based approaches will naturally
vary, but a few examples have repeatedly proved
fruitful for businesses facing dramatic changes in
their competitive situations.
—

Shifting from fixed to variable-based
arrangements with external service providers
allows for increased flexibility and agility as
revenue uncertainty continues. When
revenue outlook becomes more certain, these
shifts could be reserved, reverting to more
dedicated structures.

97

—

Rethinking the balance of dedicated external
sales staff and inside sales teams to focus
higher-cost resources on the higher-value
interactions and potentially reduce cost.

—

Reevaluating service models, such as by
creating tiered service levels (gold, silver,
bronze) for different parts of the business. The
team responsible for contract management, for
example, would automatically route requests
from sales teams serving key accounts to the
highest-level service team, while requests from
sales teams serving smaller customers would
be routed to a self-service option based on
contract forms.

For example, one company—with a postcrisis
reallocation in mind—has scaled its reskilling
initiatives with a focus on known areas of future
investment, expanding its curriculum for customerservice managers to cover new digital and analytics
capabilities. This first wave of trainees will form a
stable future pipeline of shared-service-center
managers, who will be well equipped to lead the
updated function as the business emerges from
the crisis.
Reimagine and reform: Reset the approach
to SG&A
With volatility already a rising concern for
leaders over the past decade, the likelihood that
reverberations will become part of the normal
course of business seems high. Companies that
realign their SG&A management can build in even
more flexibility and resilience. This is a time to codify
innovation into entirely new ways of working, based
on robust, virtual working capabilities, strengthened
collaboration tools, and expanded channels and
modes of communication.
To sustain new ways of working, managers will
need to develop and deploy talent more effectively,
such as through targeted, accessible, on-demand
capability building to help teams work better in a
remote environment. Managers themselves will
likely need new training to oversee centralized pools

98

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

of employees, replacing the duplicative “shadow
functions” structure in which business units staffed
their own HR, IT, or legal teams, often in addition
to headquarters functions. And for everyone,
opportunities for up- and reskilling will aid retention
and transition as redesigned processes enable
people to focus less on repetitive, low-value-added
tasks and more on valuable decision-focused skills.
The final move to consider is to align incentives and
role-model new practices. At one organization, a
finance director took on a “cost category leadership”
role to demonstrate the behaviors expected from
other leaders. While her role was focused on
optimizing spend in the category she led, she talked
regularly with individual team members, sharing
best practices, communicating challenges to
senior leadership, and celebrating achievements
so that everyone in the organization could see that
the way people worked was really changing—and
that everyone from the top team down thought
the changes were important and valuable. Other
organizations add a new budget-transparency
component to their core performance-management
systems, so that new behaviors and mechanisms are
maintained postrecovery and reset cultural norms.

Shift the operating model
To implement the new methods described above,
three shifts in financial-planning and performancemanagement processes can help. These relate
to spend visibility, budgeting, and resource
reallocation (Exhibit 2). Across all three of these
is one common theme: move SG&A investments
where they should be—rather than where they have
always been.
Improve spend visibility
Too often, corporate leaders have only limited
understanding of what their organizations are really
spending on. This is partially due to IT and financialplanning systems, and partially to a reluctance
to share details by the people most directly
responsible for costs—the cost-center owners.

But better visibility leads to better dialogues,
choices, and trade-offs. The best type of visibility
is always forward looking, so managers can make
better decisions on spending before it occurs.
Looking backward (for example, at budgeted
amounts versus actual spending) is also helpful,
as this visibility leads to a better understanding
of any variances in budgets or plans. That helps
cost-center owners develop action plans for
future spending.
Achieving better visibility can be as simple as
defining standard forecasting templates or tools,
which are easy to aggregate and make comparisons
across functions and geographies. The inherent
uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 suggests that
planning processes would ideally incorporate

The SG&A imperative in times of crisis

several forecasted scenarios. Nevertheless,
with consistent application of the templates and
tools across the scenarios, a simple set of key
performance indicators can allow leaders to identify
outliers, ask questions, and probe on granular
investment decisions. This is in contrast to a blackbox process, where forecasts are reviewed for
SG&A in total at the business-unit level, and only
compared to the prior year.
Move toward zero-based budgeting
The second enabling shift allows for budgets and
forecasts that work from the bottom up to identify
what is required to meet current internal and
external demands, especially when those demands
are frequently changing. This can take one of two
forms: a driver-based plan or a zero-based plan.

99

Driver-based plans are helpful for indirect spend
and transactional activities where a productivity
rate can be defined. A driver-based plan takes
three inputs—the volume demanded, a rate of
productivity, and a price per unit—to calculate the
budget automatically and adjust the plan as volume
changes. For example, a telecommunications
company used a driver-based plan to model how
many outsourced call-center agents would be
required as call volume increased and decreased.
An automotive-distribution company is using a
driver-based plan to flex their driver and fleet
capacity as volume declines in the near term and
comes back in the recovery. In both examples, the
companies have effectively merged their financial
and operational plans to eliminate duplicative work
and keep the two plans in sync.
A zero-based plan is relevant for more strategic and
discretionary activities. A zero-based plan means
truly starting with a clean slate, with no reference
point or other inputs, which forces the manager
to define what they truly need. For example, an
appliance manufacturer is using a zero-based
budget to define, force-rank, and prioritize all outside
services spend. This organization started by asking
cost-center owners to plan all one-time projects from
a cleansheet and do their own prioritization. This
function-level prioritization was then aggregated
for the executive team to review and decide how to
allocate scarce financial and human resources. In
this example, the executive team defined multiple
thresholds that allowed them to pull back or further
invest as market conditions evolved.
Dynamically reallocate resources
The final operating shift required is toward dynamic
resource reallocation, which requires cost centers to
plan in two steps: first, only for their bare minimum
needs, and second—separately—for value-added
investments and strategic initiatives. This simple
change enables decisions to be made as business
scenarios unfold, so that management teams can
promptly defer, pause, or accelerate strategic

100

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

initiatives. It is also powerful in unlocking the tight
grip managers hold on their budgets, and identifying
which spend is truly discretionary.
In the first step, managers identify what is required
to “keep the lights on,” using a simple but clear
definition. For example, “If I don’t spend this for two
years, will we lose significant sales or market share?”
In the second step, managers propose value-added
activities, including both cost and benefits (financial
or otherwise). These are aggregated and compared
across the enterprise to make choices, and accept
the implications.
Some companies choose to implement an
“investment pool” approach. The executive team
can make allocation decisions from a central pool of
funds until they run out of good ideas or the fund is
depleted. The first step is done annually to minimize
work for the organization, and the second step is
typically done on a quarterly (or even monthly) basis
to fund new priorities as they come up throughout
the fiscal year.
Other companies find a more workshop-driven
approach to be helpful to create alignment. For
example, the CEO of a European consumerproducts company convened the leadership
team for a series of full-day working sessions to
discuss productivity proposals across businesses
and functions, including the appropriate level of
ambition, recommended changes, and implications
across the business (such as for new processes,
service levels, and ways of working). The team
reached consensus on everything from harmonizing
disparate management-report formats and
changing the frequency and granularity of businessforecast updates to the role that HR business
partners should play. The outcome was an aligned
view of how the team would run the business going
forward—and the productivity improvements
they would be accountable for (collectively and
individually) as a result.

These sorts of changes are best supported by a
compelling change story that helps managers see
how their actions support enterprise priorities when
they might conflict with function-specific ones. At
one industrial company, this was supported under
the banner of “margin resiliency” and a series of
communications to show how individual actions
could allow the enterprise to emerge from the crisis
stronger than they were coming in.

The current crisis has sharpened the imperative for
CFOs to drive SG&A cost transparency and capital

preservation. And while aftershocks and uncertainty
will likely continue in the short term, organizations
should remain vigilant and hopeful, identifying
spending opportunities, making short- and longterm spending choices, and resetting their cost
bases—guided by the operating-model foundations
of better spend visibility, zero-based budgeting, and
dynamic resource reallocation.
A crisis presents unique challenges complicated
by uncertainty. Zero-based principles can help
organizations thoughtfully align on what’s important
and put SG&A investments where they should be,
rather than where they have always been.

After safeguarding their employees and businesses from COVID-19,
consumer companies must develop new strategies to find micropockets of
growth amid changing consumer preferences and market dynamics.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly
and completely reshaped the consumer landscape
at the start of 2020. At the same time consumerpackaged-goods (CPG) companies were looking
to break out of a decade of inconsistent growth,
many saw their expectations of growth replaced by
a struggle for survival, while others had to ramp up
production to meet never-before-seen spikes in
consumer demand. Channels have also been shaken
up: for example, e-commerce and omnichannel
grocers have benefited greatly to date, while
restaurants and food-service companies are facing
the specter of bankruptcies and a major overhaul.
All companies must now confront the prospect of
navigating the worst economic downturn since the
Great Depression.

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
July 2020.

The transition from responding to the pandemic
to recovering and navigating the path forward
means that executives will have to manage several
priorities simultaneously: tracking changing
consumer preferences, identifying micropockets
of growth to prioritize in future plans, adjusting
commercial strategies, and becoming more agile to
pursue opportunities. As CPG companies embark
on the road to recovery, a consumer-centric,
analytics-driven, and comprehensive approach
that increases top-line revenues profitably—what
we refer to as predictive growth—has never been
more critical. Such an approach must start with
understanding the contours of the next normal.
Companies should then devise an intentional plan
to build the commercial capabilities needed to win
in the next normal and permanently adopt the agile
decision making that got them through the first
stages of the pandemic.

Contours of the next normal
In the immediate response to the pandemic, the
wave of lockdowns forced consumers to adjust
their daily routines and purchasing habits. A
critical challenge for CPG companies is to develop
comprehensive strategies that are rooted in the
needs of the consumer of the future.1 This process
starts with effectively harnessing all the insights,

1

data sources, and analytics techniques available.
Initial McKinsey research into the pandemic’s
impact explores how consumer behaviors have
changed, in many ways permanently, across eight
areas (Exhibit 1).
The stickiness of these areas and the degree to which
they penetrate a consumer segment will vary by
region and market, depending on how the pandemic
evolves and how long it takes for consumers to
get back to their “normal” ways of life. Similarly,
these eight areas’ impact on any given consumable
category can vary greatly within a market. Further,
stickiness will likely depend on the quality of the
experience, so the actions that companies take now
can have a significant impact in the next normal.
However, we believe changes in five areas will
have an impact on occasions and influence CPG
companies as they plan to achieve the right balance
of top-line growth and profitability in the future.
Life at home. During the pandemic, the home has
been recast as the new coffee shop, restaurant,
gym, and scene of entertainment—leading to an
unprecedented increase of in-home activities.
Nesting has fueled spending on at-home
categories and compelled previously offline
individuals to try e-commerce offerings; for
example, more than 10 percent of US consumers
that had never shopped for groceries online before
have started to do so. Globally, people have turned
to online sources for entertainment, learning, and
communication while exploring contactless and
digital alternatives to shopping.
Shopping and consumption. As lockdowns
have naturally reduced shopping frequency
and consumers spend more thoughtfully during
economic uncertainty, consumers have decreased
their overall spending and consumption, with the
largest impact on discretionary categories such
as jewelry and gum. In Europe and the United
States, consumer spending is on track to fall by
ten to 20 percentage points for the near future.
Importantly—driven by convenience, availability,
and affordability—almost 20 percent of consumers

indicate they have switched from preferred brands
and retailers during the pandemic, and about half
of those consumers indicate they expect to make
these switches permanent.
Health and well-being. Consumer spending has
increased in health and hygiene. Health concerns are
largest in Brazil, India, Italy, and the United States,
suggesting consumers in such markets may prioritize
future spend in these and related categories. The
higher awareness of personal health has led
consumers to embrace brands that they consider
safer; some are moving away from products that are
manufactured in harder-hit countries and toward
perceived healthier options. The United States
has seen a tenfold increase in the sales of organic
produce and a 130 percent rise in vitamins and
supplements. And in Brazil, purchases of fresh food
have outpaced groceries overall during the lockdown.
Communication and information. Consumer media
consumption has increased considerably, with a

104

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

focus on social media, digital channels, and TV and
radio. This shifting behavior has led companies
to adjust their marketing approach: some have
reduced their in-person sampling and testing, more
than 40 percent have canceled campaigns, and
65 percent plan to decrease ad spending.
Consumers have also been drawn to brands with
an active response to the COVID-19 outbreak—
especially in emerging markets—elevating the
importance of communications that matches the
prevailing consumer sentiment.
Work. The economic downturn has resulted in rising
unemployment and the disruption of traditional
business environments. Companies that were able
to transition to remote working have fueled spending
on collaboration tools and home office categories.
Executives are starting to understand the potential of
remote-work arrangements as well as the associated
challenges and are seeking to find a sustainable
balance. After having experienced the full lockdown,
80 percent of employees surveyed in China preferred

a hybrid model where they can work remotely part
of the time. Overall, the higher number of people
working from home will result in a shift of occasions.
CPG companies must monitor trends in these areas
and be prepared to reexamine and adjust their
growth strategies accordingly.

Developing a winning growth formula
for the next normal
To win in the next normal, where some degree of the
changes to these eight areas of life will stick, CPG
companies should follow a three-step predictive
growth process: predict, rebound and transform,
and sustain (Exhibit 2).
Predict consumer demand
Data and analytics have become more critical than
ever to accurately forecast demand across product
segments. The pandemic has created significant
challenges to what was already a difficult task.
Time-series data sets have been disrupted, making
it more difficult to identify trends, and we don’t yet
know the extent of a given trend’s stickiness in
specific regions, markets, or categories. One-off
effects that should be considered include workfrom-home arrangements, temporary closures of
schools and restaurants, brand switching caused
by stockouts, and shifting channel and retail-outlet
preferences as shopping occurs closer to home.
Consumer responses to the pandemic have made

demand more difficult to gauge accurately. The
past is no longer a predictor of future demand.
In the initial stages, the spike in purchases of
certain categories was caused, in part, by pantry
loading in preparation for shortages. So while
actual consumption during this time didn’t rise,
spending toward some foods (such as lunch meat)
did increase. Other categories (such as beauty
supplies) saw a drop-off because of declining
consumer confidence. Through the use of analytics,
companies should seek to recognize these patterns
and plan for a potential second wave of outbreaks.
We believe CPG companies should rely on three
principles when developing more accurate category,
brand, and product projections for the next normal:
—

Base analytics on the most up-to-date
understanding of consumer behaviors. As
countries gradually transition out of lockdowns,
CPG companies will need to develop a robust
comprehension of the short- and long-term
applicability and impact of changes in consumer
behavior. This process is usually best informed
by a mix of consumer sentiment research,
proprietary category-specific research, online
search, and digital engagement data.

—

Harness a wide range of data sources as
inputs for fit-for-purpose machine-learning
techniques. The pandemic has forced companies
to aggregate and process more data and data
sources than they likely have in the past. By

together offline and online data with dozens of
macroeconomic variables—such as GDP and
the consumer price index. Consumer sentiment,
social listening, search trends, and categoryspecific data (for example, products that tie in
with movie releases) should augment these data
sources. Finally, machine-learning techniques
can identify underlying predictors of consumer
trends.
— Translate insights into scenarios that help
provide corridors for the unknown. Since there
are still degrees of unknown (for example, the
future progression of COVID-19 in a given
market or the effectiveness of government
stimuli in jump-starting economies), CPGs
must navigate multiple scenarios—and

concentrate on the most likely ones as time
passes and certainty increases. Companies
should use data and analytics to explore a
range of scenarios and determine the demand
elasticity of specific categories.
To some extent, these three elements should be
iterative as frequent revisions will contribute to
refined, more precise scenarios over time. A set
of scenarios developed in a given month should
be regularly updated with new data and insights
(Exhibit 3).
Rebound and transform to thrive
As lockdowns lift and detailed demand forecasts
help identify growth opportunities, companies
should prioritize rebounding and transforming. Plans
to boost organic growth should include four core
commercial capability areas: portfolio and innovation
strategy, marketing, revenue growth management
(RGM), and sales (omnichannel and in-store
excellence). Any or all of these areas could apply for

every company, but their mix will vary by context—the
timing of the transition to the next normal, geography,
product categories, share position, and existing
capabilities, among other factors. As part of efforts
to achieve profitable growth, executives should
evaluate, at a minimum, all four capabilities.
Portfolio and innovation strategy. In the wake of the
pandemic, CPGs will need to realign their product
portfolios and innovation engines with changing
consumer needs; this capability will be more critical
than ever in the next normal. Companies too often
rely on commoditized data and insights, settle for
small moves that don’t meaningfully improve the
top line, or struggle to scale disruptive innovation
sustainably. By contrast, winning companies deploy
multiple capabilities, including consumer-back
analytics (that is, growth maps or other granular
views into consumer behavior) and “right brain”
creative thinking early in the portfolio-strategy
process. They build new full-stack-innovation
operating models that lead from insights to strategy
to execution, and they redesign products using a
renovation-to-value approach to better meet true
consumer needs. Last, leading companies establish
integrated-delivery mechanisms such as innovation
garages—cross-functional teams empowered to
develop disruptive innovations end to end.
With these insights in hand, companies should
reassess their portfolios against next-normal trends
and rapidly accelerate their innovation pipelines to
meet consumer preferences for affordability, health
and hygiene, and packaging. Big brands, which once
again have momentum, should channel “small brand”
test-and-learn capabilities and focus on renovating
and innovating bigger platforms. Such moves will
enable big brands to respond to evolving consumer
needs across new product development, package
configuration, and sustainability.
These companies must also look to portfolio
simplification and streamlining R&D processes
to increase speed to market, cut small projects
with low returns on investment, and refocus
investment on high-ROI projects—as well as build
the organizational muscle to assess their overall

How CPG companies can sustain profitable growth in the next normal

portfolios and core SKUs in each channel on a
rolling basis.
Marketing. COVID-19 reset the way consumers
view products and brands. In a time of uncertainty,
companies that demonstrate both empathy and
how their products could provide comfort and
security are the ones to excel. Executives also
have the opportunity to translate potentially
temporary effects (such as pantry loading and brand
switching) into more sustainable gains. Accelerating
investments in selected areas can create more
stickiness. Media consumption has shifted to
digital even further than in the preceding decade.
Meanwhile, with many companies cutting back
on media spending, media rates have plummeted,
offering a window to connect with consumers in a
moment of captive attention.
Leading CPG companies have looked to data-rich
industries that had once raised the bar in areas like
contextual personalization and targeting. This new
approach moves away from the “mass reach with
mass waste” model to embrace personalization
across products and messaging in digital platforms
such as video on demand. Speaking to customers
through their preferred channels and addressing
their current needs—with the right tone, language,
and brand promise—will be critical to success in the
next normal.
Data-driven marketing yields three valuable tools:
granular consumer audience creation, which entails
developing a 360-degree view of the consumer and
identifying relevant target groups with different
needs; a content-creation model that enables more
personalized (or at least segmented), engaging
content to outperform “mass” efforts; and dynamic
placement and measurement, which allocates and
optimizes spending across channels.
Ongoing cost pressure will compel leading
companies to look for opportunities to find
efficiencies (for example, reduce nonworking
spending and reallocate resources from low-ROI
channels) to fuel growth. As CPGs deploy funds
back into high-ROI marketing channels in the

107

next normal, they will require a more-dynamic,
hypercustomized approach to provide consumers
with the personalized experience they expect.
Revenue growth management. Over the past five
to ten years, most CPG companies have built basic
capabilities in RGM—the discipline of achieving
sustainable, profitable growth through a range
of strategies focused on assortment, promotions,
trade management, and pricing. More recently,
companies that have generated outsized impact
from RGM have done so by supplementing basic and
tactical capabilities with a long-term strategic focus;
scaling capabilities across markets, divisions, and
categories; and relying more heavily on data and
advanced analytics.
The best companies in a post-COVID-19 world will
continue these efforts while also elevating RGM
to adapt in several ways.2 To take the right action,
CPG companies will need to rapidly understand
changes in consumer preferences, such as trading
down on products and brands, and the implications
of these changes on assortment by channel and
corresponding price architecture. In addition,
adapting quickly to changing shopping occasions
and missions requires a reassessment of promotion
strategy. And the pandemic’s impact on the channel
and retail landscape will necessitate adjustments to
assortment and trade-management practices.
At many CPG companies, RGM functions and
capabilities are currently ill suited to achieve the
expected outcomes for several reasons. The
companies’ processes are often too bogged down
by overall corporate-planning processes, the skill
sets of RGM team members are not sufficient to
accommodate rapid updates, and organizations
lack access to sufficient data. CPG companies must
begin addressing and potentially transforming now.
Without urgent action, they risk losing share to
competitors with RGM capabilities that are nimbler
and more advanced.
Holistic omnichannel sales strategy. CPG sales
models have been under pressure over the past

2

108

five years as a result of retailer consolidation, the
emergence of buying groups, and a continued shift
to omnichannel and value channels. In the next
normal, sales employees will have to embrace more
frequent and agile decision making and increased
omnichannel partnerships to respond to potentially
permanent shifts in shopping and consumption
(such as increased digital usage and new retailer
and brand preferences). We believe the CPG sales
model needs to fundamentally transform.
Sales leaders will determine how to serve an
increasingly differentiated market. Doing so
will require them to develop a granular view
of omnichannel growth priorities and identify
opportunities in outlets, micro markets, or consumer
segments. These opportunities can’t be assessed in
isolation; instead, executives must take into account
their organization’s competitive differentiators.
Variances in channel and customer profitability
mean that sales leaders will need to make trade-offs:
companies using a portfolio approach can capture
the most valuable pockets of growth while balancing
margins on lower-growth accounts.
The pandemic accelerated the shift to online
channels by three to four years, so omnichannel
must now function as way to engage with
consumers broadly. Depending on the organization’s
starting point, CPG sales leaders might focus on
forging more omnichannel partnerships, creating
clear channel strategies, and improving e-category
management. At the same time, they should
be developing new capabilities—performance
marketing, customer journeys, and direct-toconsumer supply chain management—that can be
shared with other functions in the organization.
Across key account management, we expect the
new, agile ways of working developed during the
early stages of the pandemic to become the next
normal. The quick adoption of digital processes and
agile decision making led to a faster commercial
cadence and reduced planning—from quarters to
weeks. Frequent ad hoc sharing of insights and
category reviews will offer a way to jointly create

value and respond to rapidly changing consumer
trends and shopper behaviors. In the medium to
long term, we see winning sales leaders developing
additional mechanisms to tailor customer
engagement based on individual characteristics;
for example, joint business planning could evolve to
focus on deep, long-term joint value creation with
a few selected partners while transitioning to B2B
online portals for all other customers.
Last, for in-store sales excellence, leaders will
digitize and automate route to market (RTM) and
their direct sales force to super-charge activation
at the point of sale. Companies will need to adapt
their service models to changing retail restrictions.
For example, route-to-market models have
incorporated more contactless modes, which
often proved more cost effective. The use of B2B
platforms for distributors and end customers will
become an integral part of the value proposition,
and competition with digital disruptors and
aggregators will intensify.
Companies should seek to dynamically define the
RTM model for each customer segment, basing
the frequency and mode of service on the growth
potential and ROI. They can then redeploy sales
efforts from underperforming segments to other
value-added activities and adjust over time to
accommodate for changes in demand and
possible disruptions.
Sustain performance with agile new models
COVID-19 forced CPG companies to accelerate
the pace of operations because their very survival
depended on moving quickly. Decisions that used
to require months of deliberations were made in

just weeks or days. Executives, having seen what’s
possible, have no reason to go back. An agile
operating model will change the ways of working
to achieve better outcomes more rapidly. Agility
and a test-and-learn philosophy can sustain the
organizational strengths that emerged during the
pandemic and enable CPG companies to respond to
evolving consumer needs in real time.
For instance, agile war rooms that use data
to target consumer segments on a microlevel
can contribute significantly to growth. Even
companies with advanced marketing functions
have increased revenues by shifting to agile
marketing. Organizations are now experimenting
with similar agile teams to go after opportunities
for joint business planning that could yield doubledigit growth from the companies’ most strategic
customers. Across commercial functions, the
response center that was formed to lead the
pandemic response should evolve to become the
new model to deliver growth and instill obsessive
performance tracking as the new way of working.

When everything changes, business as usual
isn’t an option. In times of crisis, companies can
gain a robust competitive advantage with a razorsharp focus on identifying pockets of growth.
CPG companies that were preparing for
incremental growth this year are now focused on
navigating toward the best position in the next
normal. Predictive growth, fueled by data and
analytics, can give them the insights and tools
they need and help transform core commercial
capabilities to excel.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

The coronavirus outbreak is first and foremost a
humanitarian crisis. As the situation evolves, the
number-one priority for all companies must be the
health and safety of employees and customers. At
the same time, consumer-packaged-goods (CPG)
leaders are facing an increasingly unpredictable
and dynamic economic future, which will require
thoughtful action to guide their business through
the crisis.

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
May 2020.

Broadly, companies are focusing on three phases
of action. The first is to navigate the now by
safeguarding and protecting their employees,
their customers, and the viability of their business.¹
The second is to reorient the business so it can
navigate the disruption and plan for the recovery.
Finally, the most sophisticated companies
are already positioning their business for the
next normal after the crisis. Revenue growth
management (RGM)—the discipline of driving
sustainable, profitable growth through a range of
strategies around assortment, promotions, trade
management, and pricing—has an important role
to play in phases two and three.
RGM strategies have traditionally allowed top
performers to generate profits that they can

reinvest in innovation and brand building. Sustaining
this approach through the crisis will be a major
challenge, as some categories have seen demand
crater, and most consumers are bracing for a
weak economic outlook. (Only 35 percent of US
consumers were optimistic or very optimistic about
economic conditions after COVID-19,² and only 10 to
15 percent in Italy, France, Spain, and the UK.³)

Navigate the disruption
The crisis has affected consumer-goods companies
in very different ways through changes in
consumer behavior across several dimensions:
category consumption, channel selection, shopper
trip frequency, brand preference, and media
consumption. (For an overview of these changes
and their implications for demand, see Rapidly
forecasting demand and adapting commercial
strategies in a pandemic.)
These changes in consumer behavior require a
new type of rapid planning, with a high level of
uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of
changes in consumer behavior. We recommend a
“SPRINT” approach, which can be completed in four
to six weeks (Exhibit 1).

The essence of the SPRINT model is to develop
a view of the expected revenue and margin
evolution of the business based on each
category-level demand archetype, and then
to design appropriate actions across multiple
commercial dimensions. The SPRINT model is
comprehensively laid out in Rapidly forecasting
demand and adapting commercial strategies in a
pandemic. We focus here on the RGM component
in step 5 (‘N’):
Navigate RGM adjustments with caution. Coupled
with supply realities, any demand spikes or dropoffs will create opportunities and challenges
for CPGs. With respect to the four core aspects
of RGM (pricing, promotions, assortment and
portfolio, and trade), companies need to tread
carefully. Any action on RGM should abide by the
principle of building stronger relationships with

customers and consumers (for example, by
extending payment terms for more vulnerable
customers or by delaying planned price
increases on essentials). At the same time, there
will be value-driving actions to take (Exhibit 2).

Plan for the next normal
Even as companies work nonstop to stabilize
their business, we believe it is critical to allocate
significant time to planning for the postcrisis
phase. It can be as simple as executives
spending a few hours every week thinking
ahead, or as committed as assigning a specific
team responsibility for creating RGM plans for
2021 and beyond. To succeed at RGM in the
next normal, CPG companies need to focus
on consumers, shoppers, and customers, and
define scenarios for each.

Consumers
Product and brand preferences—leading to
assortment and pricing changes
Stockpiling and product unavailability are
disrupting consumers’ traditional preferences for
specific brands or product attributes, especially
in categories deemed essential. As a result, 30 to
40 percent of US consumers and 65 to 75 percent
of those in India and Vietnam have already tried
alternative brands or products during COVID19.⁴ The expected postcrisis recession is likely to
exacerbate this trend as consumers look for and
switch to more affordable options.
To respond, CPGs will need to make assortment
and pricing changes:
—

Re-evaluate portfolio positioning and packprice architecture, and consider whether
to change the pricing for certain SKUs or
launch new packs that are more affordable
or convenient. One coffee-subscription
company saw growing consumer demand for
its home-delivered coffee and made a fivepound pack, normally reserved for wholesale,
available to end consumers online, which was
an instant hit.⁵

—

Consider whether they need new sub-brands
with a differentiated proposition, specifically
as an affordability play or to fulfill needs that
matter more to consumers post-COVID-19.

—

Consider whether to invest in a specific growth
category through innovation or M&A. As an
example, many manufacturers of beauty
and personal-care products have started to
produce alcohol gels to support health workers
and their communities. Now, with increased
demand for hygiene products, should these
become part of their standard offering?

— Address health concerns, in particular
hygiene-conscious packaging. Examples are
beverage companies adding aluminum-foil
tops on cans or fresh-food producers packing
products. Notably, these changes will also
need to align with consumers’ rising standards
on sustainability.
Consumption occasions—leading to assortment
and promotions changes
The shift to at-home consumption may become
structural as consumer habits around working
from home or spending social time outside
change. Since the impact would vary by category,
consumer-goods companies need to have a clear
understanding of this evolution by holding new
consumer-usage panels more frequently or using
new household-penetration data in more detail.
Early evidence from China also suggests that
some of the consumption occasions most
impacted by COVID-19 are not likely to return
quickly to precrisis levels, and recovery is not
uniform across the country. In Tier-1 cities, sales in
restaurants and food service in early March (with
reopening rates above 90 percent) were still 40
percent lower than in December 2019.⁶
CPG companies will need to leverage these
insights to develop new occasion-led assortment
and promotion strategy changes. If occasion
insights are not yet a significant input to
activation and innovation strategy, now may be
the time to bring them forward. This can lead to
developing products better suited to new or more
important occasions, reallocating communication
investment toward them, and improving the
activation of products to match the occasions.
Several wine companies, for example, have started
to offer virtual educational wine tastings, with
complimentary at-home delivery.

Shoppers

—

Shopping occasions / missions—leading to
promotions changes
Stock-up missions in grocery retail significantly
increased during the initial crisis and may continue
to be more functional, shorter, fewer in number,
and higher in ticket value. In addition, the shopper
may change: in China, male shoppers at brick-andmortar stores increased more than 50 percent
during the crisis.⁷
With consumers spending less time in stores, space
for second placements is potentially restricted
due to social distancing and a changing shopper
profile. CPG companies need to redesign their
promotional plans and reallocate budgets, including
stimulating new-promotion volume uplifts, returns
on investment, and reflecting changes in the
assortment focus.

Various data sources and analysis techniques
can help CPGs monitor these shopping habits
very closely. For example, shopper surveys and
geospatial-location data can shed light on how
shopping behaviors and missions are changing—
and given how fast the crisis is evolving, weekly or
monthly updates are desirable.
Companies should start positioning themselves
now to succeed by:
—

accelerating efforts to win in growing
purchasing channels such as e-commerce and
click & collect, including expanding e-category
management capabilities and providing easyto-handle, e-commerce-specific packaging.
A consumer products brand, for example,
refocused its promotional budget on its own
website, offering over 50 percent discounts to
match customers’ changes in channel focus.

—

ensuring sufficient product availability and
distribution of a “must-have assortment”
across all store types. Companies could also
consider having a presence in the discount
channel, provided they carefully assess the
tradeoffs of such a move.

Channel and store preferences—leading to
assortment and trade management changes
Shoppers are trying new ways of shopping and
many may stick with them, leading to dramatic
channel shifts:
—

E-commerce is growing, albeit at vastly
different speeds in different places. US
grocery e-commerce household penetration
increased from 13 percent before the pandemic
to more than 31 percent in late March.⁸ This
acceleration is likely to remain to some extent
after lockdowns are over, with consumers in Asia
expecting to shop online significantly more after
the crisis than they did before: +15 percent in
China, +16 percent in Indonesia, +38 percent in
India, and +47 percent in Vietnam.⁹

7

Bricks-and-mortar retail is seeing a
substantial change in store mix and shopper
experience. For example, in Europe, 14 percent
of shoppers switched to a discount store, and
in the US, 17 percent of shoppers were already
going to new stores during the COVID-19
situation. In China, 50 percent of shoppers
who had changed stores reported they do not
intend to shift back.10

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

In light of the changes to channel and store
preferences described above, CPG companies
will need to focus efforts with customers along
four dimensions:
Strengthen operational relationships to ensure
the basics are in place—for example, ensuring
an effective supply chain to make sure there is
always stock.
Support customers who may be under critical
pressures—this can include extending payment
terms or temporarily enabling consignmentbased selling models. For example, an
alcoholic-beverage company is encouraging
outlet consumers to buy gift cards that can be
redeemed later, helping to protect one of its core
channels.
Reassess focus of investments across
customers, given likely changes in the channel
landscape, and who are going to be the “new
winners.” CPG companies will need to redefine
their customer segmentation and purposefully tie
investment amounts, components, and size to the
new segmentation.
Redefine trade-terms agreements with retailers,
as they are being disrupted by changes in
shopper habits and preferences. This will include
changes to:
—

promotion plans—as noted above,
promotional uplifts and returns are likely to
fundamentally change, and CPG companies
will need to reset promotional plans agreed
with retailers, redefining terms, in particular

fixed-sum payments.
—

growth bonus thresholds—as shoppers spend
more on essentials and less on discretionary
items, growth thresholds may be arbitrarily hit or
become completely out of reach.

—

timing of annual negotiations—negotiations
between CPGs and retailers typically start
gearing up at the end of Q3 and accelerate in
Q4. However, in light of the crisis, CPGs may
want to delay negotiations until they have
more clarity on what the next normal looks like,
negotiate different components at different
times, or agree to more flexible terms. At all
times, companies should avoid being locked into
a contract that has not been adjusted for the
new reality.

There is no playbook for navigating a global
pandemic, and there are shifts that will be hard to
anticipate. But experience shows that companies
that take a proactive approach, repositioning
themselves to navigate the disruption and planning
ahead for the postcrisis world as best they can,
stand the best chance of not only surviving but
coming out on the other side stronger. Companies
that already have a dedicated RGM function should
be putting that capability at the forefront of their
effort. The actions they help direct should deliver
for consumers and shoppers and strengthen
relationships with key customers.

Will innovation finally
add up for consumergoods companies?
In a changing landscape, companies can better meet consumers’ needs by
understanding the true value of innovation.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

In response to massive consumer-behavior
changes due to COVID-19, multiple con­sumer
companies have recently announced cutbacks in
their innovation pipelines. These announce­ments
may signal a new era for the consumer-packagedgoods (CPG) sector, one in which the innovation
agenda can escape the endless line extensions of
the past several years. The lower-value launches
that pervaded pre-pandemic innovation portfolios
have failed to drive meaningful growth or return
on investment for many CPGs (Exhibit 1). The
average first-year sales for new-product pacesetters
declined by an astonishing 50 percent between
2012 and 2018.1
Innovation will be more important than ever as
we move toward the next normal amid changing
consumer needs and occasions. Companies can
rethink their innovation agendas to more effectively
address those needs and drive growth. However,
many executives see barriers to boosting innovation
1

performance, including the complexity of multi­
functional organizational dynamics and the difficulty
of predicting consumer preferences and behaviors.
In addition, these innovations seem to be occuring
faster than ever. Disruption due to the pandemic
lends even greater urgency to ensuring that innova­
tion strategies adapt well to changes in con­sumer
needs and retail environments.
The industry has been weighed down by innovation
that fails to deliver meaningful, incremental growth.
While challenges exist, they can be overcome. CPG
companies can significantly boost the performance
of innovation by measuring it more effectively,
managing it more strategically, identifying
ideas worth pursuing, and supporting them with
necessary resources. Understanding the true,
incremental impact of innovation is fundamental to
developing a pipeline that delivers on the strategic
objectives of the company.

Leading CPG innovators aim
to be first to scale, rather than
first to market.

Implement a better measure
of innovation
In a previous article, we described successful
innovators’ strategies, agile processes, investment
approaches, and organizations.2 The first element
of a winning model is to focus on targeted consumer
needs. For example, instead of casting a broad
net, they aim precisely at well-defined pockets of
winnable opportunity that are linked to a broader
platform. They launch more “speedboats”3 by
applying agile approaches to iterate their way to
growth instead of risking everything on a few
big bets. They also manage innovation as venture
investment managers would, tracking progress
against key performance indicators, adapting
quickly to in-market performance, and appointing
leaders to make decisions with autonomy.
Leading CPG innovators also aim to be first to scale,
rather than first to market. They identify highpotential ideas and trends and then leverage size
to get to scale quickly.
Many companies also aim to have better insight
into innovation impact that can inform the next set
of innovations to launch. We previously described
how companies can benchmark their overall
innovation performance using measures of R&D-toproduct conversion and new-products-to-margin
conversion.4 These metrics provide valuable insights
on efficacy of R&D dollars and impact of new
products on overall margin. We now have the rigorous
data, systems, processes, and analytic know­how to
expand this to include additional metrics.

Currently, many companies track the share of sales
coming from innovation, known as the vitality index.
But with its simplistic focus on total revenue, this
metric not only fails to differentiate profitable
and unprofitable investments but also evaluates
all innovation through the same lens, regardless of
strategic intent. The vitality index is a kind of ther­
mom­eter: it measures temperature but does not
improve health. It can distract companies into shifting
volume, effectively cannibalizing existing sales,
rather than driving more valuable and disruptive
inno­vation. Indeed, many companies with a strong
vitality index—as much as 20 percent of sales from
products launched in the past three years—are not
growing their top lines. In a world of endless line
extensions, the feel-good vitality index is becoming
less and less meaningful. The decline in first-year
sales of new products is evidence of the challenge
facing large brands.
In a postpandemic world, this challenge of
anticipating consumers’ needs—and managing
innovation to address those needs—is likely to get
tougher as a result of massive, lasting behavioral
disruption across consumers, categories, and
channels. Consumers are placing greater priority
on necessities. They’re seeking larger sizes, shelfstable and easy-to-prepare products, and products
that deliver a higher value. They’re shifting their
shopping behavior to online and direct-to-consumer
channels. Changes in disposable income and
consumer attitudes increasingly favor brands that
stand for trust, safety, health, and value. Established

brands, which had been suffering slow growth
compared with smaller, more nimble brands, have
now rebounded and account for nearly half of
growth (Exhibit 2).
Leading companies are evaluating and adjusting
their portfolio strategies in anticipation of the
eventual recovery. Many are acting decisively to
adjust assortment, fill product gaps, evolve
price-pack architecture, adjust promotional activity,
and increase omnichannel presence. Some
companies are further exploring ways to align brand
priorities with growth opportunities and accelerate
the right innovation initiatives to compete effectively
in an altered landscape. One leading food marketer
sought to establish a more consistent and objective
process for assigning limited resources to the right
places earlier in the process. To achieve this, the
company’s innovation team is testing a data-driven
approach to simulating innovation potential ahead of
extensive product-development and -launch efforts.
5

The pandemic is also lowering barriers to brand
switching. According to a recent survey, 75 percent
of consumers have started a new shopping
behavior—including 36 percent of consumers who
have purchased new or alternative brands and
products—often out of necessity due to product
unavailability but also out of changing attitudes.5
This potential for easier trial may be good news
for future innovation. But before that happens,
marketers will need to know which past innovations
have been successful and why (or why not); this
knowledge is key for ensuring that innovation
strategies can meet evolving consumer needs in a
demanding retail environment.
It is critical to measure, simplify, and manage
innovation performance differently and more effec­
tively. To identify the true impact of innovation,
marketers need a strategic and fact-based view.

allow senior leaders to make superior decisions
on the R&D, marketing, branding, and commercial
levers used to support those innovations. A disci­
plined approach allows companies to institutionalize
the process of learning and incorporate lessons
back into strategic planning. Most important, it can
shift organizational mindsets toward a relentless
focus on ensuring that innovation works.
To accomplish this, we recommend three
improvements to innovation: determining strategic
roles, measuring net incrementality, and shifting
evaluation from sales to profit and returns.
Determine strategic roles for each innovation
Not all innovations are equal. The most successful
innovators understand the roles different kinds of
innovation play in the overall growth algorithm—and
the portfolio composition required to reach growth
targets. Portfolio innovation can be grouped in four
categories, each with a distinct role and a different
path to achieve scale (Exhibit 3):

—

Line extension, a low-risk, close variant of
an exist­­ing brand that delivers the same
essential benefit proposition—such as vanillaflavored soy milk

—

Innovation expansion, in which a new product
in the same category delivers new or more
benefits in ways that fundamentally expand total
category potential—such as almond milk in the
space of plant-based beverages

—

Disruptive innovation, where marketers innovate
to enter white space (new categories or
business models) to serve new or unmet needs,
reach new opportunities, and engage
with consumers in pioneering ways—such as
plant-based beverages as alternatives to
dairy milks

—

Renovation of an existing brand’s positioning,
product, or packaging to deliver improved
benefits—such as cookies without trans fats;

this underused approach can benefit growth
by delivering meaningful differentiation to the
entire brand in a cost-efficient way
It is critical to measure each type of innovation
against different standards of performance and
over varying investment horizons. One critically
insightful and necessary measure of performance is
incre­mentality, or the portion of innovation volume
that comes from new buyers and additional usage
occasions. Incrementality can also be thought
of as a new product’s volume after netting out
cannibalization from a brand’s existing buyers.
A typical line extension’s incrementality might
not exceed 10 percent, but it should require less
support and pay out more quickly. An expansion,
which requires greater product differentiation and
spend­ing, can deliver incrementality of 20 to 50
percent. Disruptive innovation can deliver more
than 50 percent in incrementality but typically
requires more time and money to develop and
scale. It is important to note that true breakthrough
innovation (a step further than disruptive) requires
different measurement approaches (both before
and after launch).
Measuring innovation in the context of a portfolio
helps senior leaders set the right performance
bars for each initiative. It also provides strategic

flexibility in innovation sequencing and mixes
that can deliver both near-term results and sus­
tained portfolio growth.
For example, a leading food manufacturer found
that its rate of innovation was similar to those of
its peers, but two-thirds of its launches were line
extensions that yielded little incremental revenue.
Many investments in innovation produced negative
returns, diverting valuable resources from the
more disruptive ideas required to build sustainable
competitive advantages. With a clearer view of
end-to-end profit and return on investment (ROI),
including capital- and operational-expenditure
costs, the senior team reprioritized innovation
initiatives, favoring expansion and disruptions over
line extensions. The shift significantly improved net
sales, gross margins, and ROI.
Measure net incrementality to the portfolio
A critical step is measuring each innovation’s true
incremental impact to the brand and portfolio, net
of cannibalization. Measuring the baseline can
often prove a tricky affair. But recent advances in
analytics using data-driven models of consumer
behavior have made it possible to measure true
incrementality while controlling for other factors.
This shifts the conversation from what to sell toward
which consumer behaviors innovation should strive
to replace. The focus on incrementality is useful

of a portfolio helps senior leaders
set the right performance bars for
each initiative.

as the new product cannibalized marketing support
from the rest of the brand’s products, resulting in
negative ROI (Exhibit 4). These shortfalls persuaded
senior leaders that they needed to innovate in
growing spaces, create more differentiated benefits,
and avoid cannibalizing the parent brand of its
own marketing support.

both in post­launch evaluation and in identifying
where to play when developing innovation strategy.
Incrementality metrics can identify impact from
new buyers to a brand and portfolio as well as
incremental purchasing from existing buyers, net of
cannibalization.
For example, a leading brand of household cleaners
launched a close-in line extension touting superior
cleaning benefits, but it resulted in less than 20
per­cent incrementality because it had entered
a crowded space where headroom was limited.
The challenge was even more difficult given the
dynamics of a category with limited expandability,
a high bar for consumer credibility, and consumer
momentum moving from liquid cleaners to tools.
Moreover, the overall brand declined by 4 percent

A similar analysis in the milk and milk-alternatives
market shows that plant-based beverages such
as almond or soy milk were about 44 percent incre­
mental to the overall category, meaning that
44 per­cent of growth in alternative-milk con­sump­
tion came from other beverages, not dairy milk. The
remaining 56 percent represented cannibalization
from dairy milk, a number that may sound alarming
but ultimately represented only a tenth of the

total decline in conventional dairy milk. The
quantifi­cation of true incrementality showed how
the emergence of milk alternatives was more a
symptom than the cause of decline in dairy (Exhibit 5).
Shift innovation evaluation from sales to portfolio
profit and return on investment
Marketers who manage innovation based on
incremental profitability to the portfolio, instead
of sales or share, stand to make better decisions to
drive portfolio growth. They need to measure whether
the innovation is profit accretive to the portfolio
mix and quantify the ROI. With this fresh perspective,
marketers can plan for accretive margins from
the early stages—and give more disruptive
innovation enough time and investment to
become profitable.

Will innovation finally add up for consumer-goods companies?

For example, a leading snack-food manufacturer
launched a fruit-flavored line extension of its
brand in a fragmented category. The extension
delivered the expected gross sales, based on the
size of the parent brand. And by the standards of
a line extension, its 42 percent incrementality
appeared healthy. But after fully accounting
for cannibalization and the costs of product
development, marketing, and operations, the
company discovered that the innovation
yielded a negative ROI (Exhibit 6). Although a
low ROI is not unusual for new products in
the first year, the comprehensive measurement
of incremental sales and profit led the
company to revisit resource allocation behind
line extensions.

Next steps
It may feel daunting to manage and measure innova­
tion in the context of complex portfolio-growth
strategies. But it doesn’t need to be. We recommend
starting with an unbiased assessment of the
organization’s capabilities and practices by asking
nine questions:

6. Do we set metrics and targets by type
of innovation based on objectives and
portfolio roles?

1. Does innovation empower sustainable,
profitable portfolio growth?

7. Are we able to accurately measure
innovation incrementality?

2. Do we use an analytical, data-driven framework
to choose where to innovate?

8. Do we measure the impact of innovation
to under­stand if it is margin accretive to
the portfolio?

3. Do we develop innovation systematically, based
on consumer-led and analytical insights?
4. Are we able to accurately predict the size of
innovation and sources of volume?

124

5. Do we pursue a balanced mix of
innovations with distinct roles to meet
specific strategic goals?

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

9. Does our organizational structure use
a disci­plined process to measure and
manage innovation?

In our experience, nearly every CPG company could
stand to make meaningful improvements in one
or more of these areas. Leaders who commit to
manag­ing innovation performance in more purpose­
ful and rigorous ways can expect to drive more
profitable portfolio growth through innovation.

Advances in data and advanced analytics make
it easier than ever to rapidly measure root causes
and improve innovation performance. The real
challenges lie in finding the discipline to establish
a consistent and agile measurement process, glean
the right insights from consumer and shopper data,
and apply powerful advanced analytics based on
machine learning to evaluate performance.

Accelerating the recovery

More than ever, scaling impact through digital and analytics is an

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

The pursuit of large-scale impact through digital
and analytics is not a new topic. Ask any consumergoods executive if his or her company has invested
in digital and analytics, and you’ll almost certainly
get an affirmative response. However, COVID-19
has severely accelerated disruption and highlighted
the need for reinvention across four main areas:
1. Seismic shift to digital engagement. The longer
the crisis persists, the more likely it is that
the substantial channel shift to e-commerce,
direct to consumer, and other digitally enabled
purchase journeys will be transformative
and lasting.
2. Rapidly changing consumer behavior. As
consumers shift to online channels and
dramatically change their habits, it has
become increasingly important for companies
to establish agile digital-marketing and
consumer-insights capabilities to enable better
decision making.
3. Increased focus on supply-chain resiliency.
Unpredictable demand patterns, combined
with the disruption of physical supply chains,
have resulted in high volatility and uncertainty
that require immediate and coordinated action
across manufacturing plants, suppliers,
and retailers.
4. Growing need to rethink the product portfolio.
Consumers are looking for more-convenient,
safer, and less-expensive alternatives. Suppliers
have been struggling to fulfill those needs in this
environment. Companies will have to innovate
faster, reduce complexity, and simplify the
product portfolio.
Scaling digital and analytics will be a key
differentiator between resilient and nonresilient
companies as they emerge from this crisis. In light
of the recovery and reinvention challenge that the
industry is up against, the call to action is loud

and clear: either fully tap into the power of digital
and analytics, or get left behind.
In this article, we describe the most common
pitfalls that companies encounter in their journey
toward digital and analytics scale-up, as well as the
imperatives to consider in the context of COVID-19.
We also explore an emerging recipe for success.

The most common failure modes
Drawing on our experience working with consumergoods players around the world, we have identified
the four most common failure modes—the mistakes
that hinder organizations from capturing value at
scale from digital and analytics:
1. Neglecting to connect digital and analytics
programs to the enterprise strategy. Laggards
tend to treat digital and analytics efforts as
side projects rather than important enablers of
enterprise-wide priorities.
2. Making big investments prematurely. Some
companies, enamored of having the latest
technology, invest in digital and analytics
before they thoroughly understand what the
business truly needs and what will deliver
significant impact.
3. Holding out for “perfect” hires. Laggards spend
as much as six months searching for two or three
data scientists or wait until they feel they’ve
found the “perfect” hire to lead the team.
4. Underinvesting in change management.
Executives often tell us that they wish they’d
spent as much or more on change management
as they did on technology. As a rule of thumb,
digital and analytics leaders should allocate their
energy and investment as follows: 25 percent on
data, 25 percent on technology, and 50 percent
on change management.

Complexity in the context of COVID-19
The pandemic has created additional complexity
that consumer-goods players must consider as they
navigate the recovery phase.
First, speed is more important than ever.
Companies have had to make decisions quickly.
Remote working was adopted practically

128

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

overnight, allowing companies to mobilize global
talent instantly. Organizations have realized that
this new way of working is enabling speed and
flexibility. Coming out of the crisis, many will
consider a permanent change to the traditional
operating model, and companies that fail to
adapt will most likely struggle to capitalize on
this momentum.

Second, the cost and liquidity challenges will intensify
as the economic downturn becomes more severe.
Uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19
crisis will make it challenging for companies to incur
discretionary capital expenditures—such as digital
and analytics investments—with confidence.
Third, COVID-19 will most likely increase the
availability of technical talent. As start-ups struggle
with short-term liquidity and companies across
industries look for efficiencies, there could be an
increased supply of skilled people pursuing new
challenges. Consumer-goods players can become
new hubs for digital and analytics talent.

An emerging recipe for success
Before the crisis, only a few consumer-goods
players had delivered impact at scale from digital
and analytics efforts; however, the recipe for
success is becoming clear.1 The following are four
core elements of digital and analytics success that
companies should put into practice as they navigate
the recovery.
1. Set a bold long-term aspiration
Companies should avoid articulating only a
vague, generic aspiration (“we will build excellent
analytics capabilities”), which will inevitably fail
to take hold. Instead, they must begin with a
concrete digital and analytics vision clearly linked
to the corporate strategy. One consumer-goods
company, for instance, had the following vision
for its transformation: to “create a best-in-class
sales force using digital and analytics to enable the
right actions, in the right outlets, at the right time,
executed flawlessly every day.”
Albeit long term in nature, the vision must address
themes that the COVID-19 crisis has made
more important than ever, such as e-commerce
capabilities. Coming up with a balanced aspiration—
one that is transformational but also targeted to
short-term value areas—will help determine priority
areas and investments.
1

Importantly, the aspiration must be informed by a
candid, detailed assessment of the starting point,
using a shared vocabulary and well-understood
criteria and standards to ensure that people at
all levels recognize the magnitude of the change
required. One business unit’s definition of “digital
and analytics” might be vastly different from
another’s, so it’s critical to establish a thorough
understanding of the current state of affairs and a
common definition of success.
2. Pursue ‘domain transformations,’ not
unrelated use cases
At the heart of any digital and analytics program
are use cases, which define specific business
problems to be solved through new ways of
working. Use cases can be found across the front,
middle, and back of an enterprise. They can be
grouped together in “domains”—subsets of use
cases that share a common element, such as a
deployment mechanism, data sources, or business
users (Exhibit 2). We’ve found that to bring about
transformational change, it’s best to pursue use
cases within the same domain.
In the early days of digital and analytics
transformations, companies prioritized individual
use cases, largely in the commercial functions,
based on feasibility and impact. To support the
highest-priority use cases, companies then
established a set of broad-based enablers—for
instance, a data lake, a technology stack, and
a technical organization that housed all-new
talent profiles, such as data scientists. In theory,
these enablers would meet the needs of the
entire enterprise.
In practice, however, generic enablers rarely meet
specific business requirements. Successfully
scaling up digital and analytics efforts thus
requires a different approach: one that prioritizes
fully enabled domain transformations rather than
unrelated use cases. Instead of pursuing the three
highest-impact use cases in different domains, a
company might pursue, say, the first, fourth, and

sixth highest-impact use cases, if these reside
within the same domain. The company can then
develop domain-specific enablers, such as data the
domain needs, surgical changes to the tech stack,
or capability building for business users. In this way,
the company reaps higher returns on its investment
because these enablers support all the use cases
within that domain.
This approach also allows companies to tackle
each domain’s unique challenges. The sales
analytics and merchandising domain, for
instance—particularly for large, dispersed sales
organizations—typically requires an intense focus
on handheld tools linked to the core tech stack and
deployed through broad-based capability building.
On the other hand, the revenue-management and

about sophisticated, granular analytics conducted
by a relatively contained team, with limited
implications for the tech stack. By transforming
domains, companies can home in on these domainspecific challenges and more rapidly achieve
impact at scale.
Domain transformations in the middle of the
enterprise are often the most difficult: consumerpackaged-goods (CPG) companies typically have
hundreds (or even thousands) of people in their
supply-chain organizations, as well as multiple data
sources scattered across planning teams, plants,
and distribution centers. One CPG manufacturer
had historically struggled to optimize the availability
of its products while keeping the cost of goods
sold (COGS) and inventory low. The executive
team agreed to prioritize one domain—sales and

Data and architecture are among the
toughest enablers for consumer-goods
organizations to get right.

operations planning (S&OP)—and selected two
use cases within that domain that would both
deliver outsize impact and build the necessary
foundations for future efforts. The first use case
was digitized end-to-end supply-chain planning;
the second was demand forecasting based on
point-of-sale (POS) data.
The main enablers of the domain transformation
included a data ecosystem that integrated inputs
from more than 100 data sources and became the
organization’s “single source of truth”; a robust set
of digital and analytics tools—jointly chosen and
refined by the planning managers and use-case
experts—to automate key portions of the planning
process and free up the planning team’s capacity;
and an intensive capability-building effort that
touched all 200-plus people spread out across
multiple planning cells. This third enabler, overlooked
in previous transformation efforts, was crucial to
success, especially in light of the wide variability in
technical expertise across the talent pool.
The impact was evident within the first year: higher
revenues through lower out-of-stock levels and
better customer service, reduced costs through
a decrease in the number of obsolete products,
and significantly reduced inventory through lower
safety stocks. The company’s demand-forecasting
accuracy, already above average for the industry,
improved by more than six percentage points. In
hindsight, prioritizing this domain was critical to
establishing a competitive advantage in a COVID-19
environment, where the capacity to react quickly
has become a true differentiator.

3. Ensure the coherence of enablers
across domains
Each domain must be fully enabled to succeed—
but there must also be coherence in the enablers
as they are built out across domains. Creating a
bespoke digital and analytics organization for
each domain, for example, isn’t sensible. Instead,
leading companies have only one digital and
analytics organization—centralized, federated, or
a mix of both—and then deploy specific skills and
capabilities to each domain as needed.
Data and architecture are among the toughest
enablers for consumer-goods organizations to get
right (see sidebar, “Instilling a healthy data culture”).
Many companies don’t have as much consumer data
and retailer point-of-sale data as they’d like. The
relevant assets they do have—internal financial,
product, and customer master data—typically
reside in siloed legacy systems that are difficult
to access and harmonize. And consumer-goods
companies tend to lack the strong data-governance
processes to use, secure, and share data across the
organization in compliance with privacy regulations.
Some consumer-goods companies, recognizing
these inadequacies, mistakenly believe that they
need to change their entire data infrastructure
at once. But in our experience, prioritizing the
enablers that will yield the greatest value is much
more effective and helps ensure the coherence of
enablers across domains.

Instilling a healthy data culture
by Alejandro Diaz and Mike Doheny

In scaling digital and analytics, the gap
between leaders and laggards—both
within and among industry sectors—is
growing. For all consumer-goods companies, the emergence of digital and analytics as omnipresent realities of modern
organizational life means that a healthy
data culture is becoming increasingly
important. A culture that brings together
data talent, tools, and decision making
can unleash competitive advantage.

or an interesting side project. The
fundamental objective in collecting,
analyzing, and deploying data should
be to make better decisions. Data
culture is decision culture.
—

Our experience suggests that instilling
a data culture strengthens the nuts and
bolts of a company’s digital and analytics
enterprise, helping it avoid the pitfalls that
often trip up transformation efforts. Here
—
are some of the practices that have helped
companies build a culture that clarifies the
purpose, enhances the effectiveness, and
increases the speed of their digital and
analytics efforts:
—

Don’t amass data for data’s sake.
Some companies approach data
analysis as a cool “science experiment”

Make sure the CEO and the board
show commitment. Leaders’
commitment to a data culture must
manifest in more than occasional
high-level pronouncements. Instead,
there must be an ongoing, informed
conversation with top decision makers
and those who lead data initiatives
throughout the organization.
Get data in front of people. Building
cool digital experiments or imposing
analytics tools top down doesn’t cut
it. To create a competitive advantage,
stimulate a grassroots demand for
data. When you put data in front of the
people who can actually use that data,
they get excited.

—

Marry talent and culture. The
competition for data talent is
unrelenting. But there’s another
element that’s sometimes overlooked:
integrating the right talent for your
data culture. That calls for striking the
appropriate balance for your company
between hiring new employees and
upskilling current ones. Take a broader
view in sourcing talent and a sharper
look at the skills your data team requires.

Culture can be a compounding problem or
a compounding solution. When an organization’s data mission is detached from business strategy, it should come as no surprise
that the results of digital and analytics initiatives fail to meet expectations. But when
excitement about data analytics infuses the
entire organization, it becomes a source
of energy and momentum. The technology,
after all, is amazing. Imagine how far it can
go with a culture to match.

McKinsey’s work in digital and analytics in the consumer sector.

for instance, it chose a decoupled technology stack
that could expand as needed. Modernizing the core
platform, typically a multiyear effort, was postponed
until the return on investment could be clearly
articulated. Instead, the company launched an
effort to develop a set of application programming
interfaces (APIs) that could effectively perform all
required data exchanges. A cloud-based data layer
would serve as the company’s single data repository

132

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

across all domains, with the APIs acting as the
communicating vessels between the top layer and
the rest of the core systems. Data were ingested
incrementally, so the company could first tackle the
most critical data elements required by the highestpriority domains and use cases.
The company also emphasized data governance
from the start of the transformation effort by

appointing a chief data officer (CDO) within the
IT organization. The CDO had “data ambassadors”
embedded into each business unit. These
ambassadors collaborated with business-line
leaders in defining the end-state requirements and
domain-specific initiatives.
4. Reconfigure your operating model for speed
and flexibility
Consumer-goods companies aren’t typically
structured to move fast or flexibly. Digital and
analytics leaders have begun to organize their
efforts around “squads” or “pods” that can move
and react more nimbly, and such investments have
proved effective under current working conditions.2
One manufacturer revamped its operating model to
incorporate the following elements:

those for infrastructure and security. It oversees
data science within each squad, as well as best
practice and knowledge sharing across squads.
— An empowered transformation office. To
help ensure the transformation’s success,
the company formed a transformation office
comprising top-team executives. During
regularly scheduled reviews, sponsors and
squad leaders update the transformation office
on the progress of initiatives; sponsors can also
pitch new ideas. This structure and cadence
allow the company’s senior leaders to track
milestones and dynamically reallocate resources
to priority areas.

— An emphasis on leadership training. Executives
and managers completed a mandatory
capability-building curriculum that taught them

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
July 2020.

So now what? That’s the eminent question US
retailers face in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
After months of quarantines and phased recovery,
it’s clear that standard operating procedures in
retail have changed and will continue to change
as health and economic implications of the novel
coronavirus evolve.
Retailers must act now, not only to keep pace but
also to thrive in new market conditions. Most will
need to significantly rethink their strategies and
business models in the next normal—for example,
what kinds of goods and services do consumers
want and need in this changed environment? What
macroeconomic factors will inform their purchasing
decisions? Which new consumer habits will stick,
and for how long?
Retailers’ ability to answer these questions and
find success in the next normal will depend, in
part, on the subsectors they operate in and their
overall liquidity. It will also hinge upon the degree
to which they can adopt new capabilities and
draw on new expertise—some of which they may
need to leverage through mergers, acquisitions,
and partnerships.
To begin this transformation process, retailers will
need to systematically assess their capabilities in
five areas that are critical for any retail operation
to succeed: revenue management, operating
models, digital, capital investments, and M&A and
partnerships. Through this exercise, retailers can

identify gaps and requirements and make bold
moves to position themselves differently in the
next normal.
In this article, we consider how the landscape
has changed for three retail subsectors—
grocery; apparel, fashion, and luxury (AF&L);
and restaurants—as well as the moves
companies in these sectors can make to adapt
and thrive postpandemic.

What’s changed
According to our “consumer of the future” research,
the pandemic has already altered consumer
purchasing patterns and behaviors in deep and
perhaps lasting ways. Given high unemployment
and widespread quarantines, for instance,
consumers are at home more often than not. They
are shopping less, spending less when they do
shop, and focusing more on health and well-being
products and concerns.
Significant macroeconomic, commercial, and cost
shifts over the past six months or so are changing
the landscape for retailers as well (Exhibit 1). Most
are anticipating limited containment of the novel
coronavirus. Those operating in discretionary
categories, in particular, are expecting a slow
recovery over the next 18 months or so. And they
expect a resurgence of the virus in late 2020 or
early 2021, which could mute long-term growth and
global recovery.

It’s clear that standard operating
procedures in retail have changed
and will continue to change.

Shifts in spending. Macroeconomic factors during
the pandemic period have altered the playing field
for retailers. Demand for discretionary products
has been significantly different than that for
nondiscretionary products. For example, demand
in the AF&L sector has dropped significantly, along
with demand in the air travel, hospitality, commercial
aerospace, and oil and gas sectors. The drop in
demand for AF&L products has hovered between
20 percent and 45 percent at various points over
the past few months. Overall numbers in the food
and restaurant industries are down, although some
segments—such as grocery stores and some
takeout restaurants—have done well. The demand
for groceries, which skyrocketed to between 7
percent and 17 percent as consumers stocked their
pantries ahead of and during the pandemic, will
likely revert to precrisis levels (between 1 percent
and 3 percent) by the first half of 2021. According
to our research, sit-down restaurants will likely
take much longer to get back to previous norms—
perhaps not until 2022 or 2023, depending on
which economic scenarios emerge.
Shifts in purchasing, loyalty, and switching.
Commercial changes as a result of the pandemic
also loom large for retailers. There’s been a
significant (if predictable) increase in online sales
and pickup and delivery services, as consumers
have been unable or unwilling to enter brick-andmortar stores for fear of infection. Over the past
several months, online shopping has increased

138

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

about 20 percent in the grocery category. As a
result, consumer loyalty has been disrupted, and
switching has become more common. This is partly
because consumers have learned to replace favored
brands with more available or more affordable ones
in the face of product shortages. More recently,
consumers have also shown little compunction
when switching to brands they can purchase
through contactless or other “safe” methods.
Shifts in footprint, safety, and labor costs. Retailer
cost considerations have also changed—among
them, greater investments in interventions required
to bolster or maintain supply chains, safeguard
employees’ and customers’ health, and maintain
staffing levels. For instance, as they have started to
reopen, restaurants have seen a marked increase
in costs because of new cleaning and socialdistancing requirements as well as greater attention
being paid to employee safety.
Of the three subsectors we examined, grocery is the
most likely to expand both revenues and margins,
given its starting point. By contrast, our research
shows that AF&L is likely to experience significant
revenue decline and margin contraction because
of consumers’ reduced discretionary spending
and increased use of e-commerce, which tends to
be a higher-cost channel for many retailers. And
the restaurant sector is likely to see profit-margin
pressure—primarily because of higher delivery
costs—as well as decreased revenue.

How to transform
Many of the disruptive trends in retail were already
in flight before COVID-19 emerged. But in many
ways, the pandemic has accelerated these trends
from decades to just days. Most retailers likely have
not fully planned or addressed all of these trends;
thus the capabilities required to transform the
business in the next normal will not be first nature
to most of them. Most have begun to expand their
use of e-commerce, social media marketing, or
analytics-based supply-chain management, but
hardly any have developed these capabilities to the
degree needed to meet current demand.
True transformation and reinvention will come only
when senior retail executives take a step back from
the turmoil and systematically evaluate their current
products, capabilities, and strategies; identify any
gaps; and devise a transformation plan (or roadmap)
for addressing those gaps. Specifically, retailers
should consider their capabilities along the following
five dimensions:
Revenue management. Retailers should assess the
full suite of revenue levers at their disposal and then
double-down on them to sustain and accelerate
sales and gross margin. For instance, senior finance
and business unit leaders can undertake a cleansheet evaluation of product assortment, price, and
promotion levers to optimize sales and customer
loyalty. They can also pursue innovations required to
address consumers’ changed needs and behaviors
as a result of the pandemic. For example, a grocer
might consider adding local, organic foods to its
product mix—goods that postpandemic consumers
may now be willing to pay a premium for.
Operating models. Successful retailers should use
this unprecedented period to rethink their operating
models—examining store footprints, labor, and
supply chains to optimize cost structures and meet
changing consumer preferences. Through this

The next normal in retail: Charting a path forward

analysis, they may identify new sales models or new
ways of working that could help alleviate margin
pressures. Something as simple as building more
flexibility into pickup and delivery operations could
help a retailer reallocate resources more effectively
and better balance demand loads.
Digital capabilities. Continued social distancing—
mandatory or voluntary—will require that retailers
develop or purchase reliable e-commerce or
digital capabilities to serve consumers who remain
concerned about health and safety in the wake of
the pandemic. Retailers may want to establish (or
accelerate) expansion into new channels, a curbside
pickup option, online-ordering applications, homedelivery options, and other digitally driven services.
Capital investments. Most retailers understand
the critical need to take a closer look at capital
investments postpandemic—not only to address
consumers’ changing preferences, but also to
position their organizations for growth in the next
normal. With increased investments in technology,
for instance, companies may be able to automate
and streamline central work processes or otherwise
accelerate digital transformation. And companies
that are experiencing increased e-commerce
demand will likely need to invest in updating their
omnichannel networks.
M&A and partnerships. For many retailers, organic
moves may be intuitive while inorganic ones, such
as M&A and partnerships, may require even more
deliberate consideration, especially in this time of
great uncertainty. A number of leading indicators
suggest that M&A and partnerships hold a lot of
promise for retailers in the next normal, as the
industry undergoes consolidation and retailers seek
new capabilities, technologies, and expertise to
address changing customer demands—and do so
quickly (Exhibit 2).

It’s important for retailers to acknowledge that not
all deals are created equal; the potential deal must
be aligned with the company’s overarching strategy.
Continued concern over the coronavirus means
most grocers will need e-commerce and alternative
delivery options, including scan-to-go and
contactless payment and pickup services. Thus they
may want to seek out deals and partnerships that
can provide the necessary technical capabilities
(speech-recognition software, for instance) and skill
sets (data scientists, for instance); for many, it may
simply take too long to acquire the expertise and
build the required new systems from scratch. By
contrast, retailers with high liquidity may be on the
lookout for bargain acquisitions that can help them
maintain or even grow revenues—such as seeking
out distressed assets or adjacent brands that can
help elevate their existing customer-loyalty tactics
and programs.
Plan-ahead team. Through a systematic selfassessment, retail executives can pinpoint the
organic and inorganic moves to execute that can
help them survive and thrive in the next normal. At

140

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

that point, a plan-ahead team should be convened
to prioritize and execute the transformation. These
teams identify the actions that can offset long-term
headwinds—such as developing new marketing
plans to counteract disruptions in brand loyalty
or determining what optimal store footprints and
shopping experiences should look like in the next
normal. The plan-ahead team collaborates with
the executive-leadership team to align on the
transformation roadmap and to monitor and report
back on the results. The plan-ahead team also
works closely with the company’s finance team
to stress-test and update budgets, as initiatives
are rolled out, and to assess acquisition targets.
Similarly, this team should engage with operations
leaders to manage the daily initiatives necessary to
drive transformation.

The outlook in three subsectors
Using the self-assessment framework, we can
see potential pathways to success in the next
normal for companies in the grocery, AF&L, and
restaurant subsectors.

The pathway for grocery
Grocery is the subsector of retail most likely to
experience revenue growth, as consumers have
changed their buying patterns and are cooking
more at home. As mentioned earlier, our analysis
indicates that topline growth in grocery will continue
but eventually stabilize. However, this sector is
also likely to face meaningful margin compression
because of the limits being placed in the short
term by states and municipalities on the number of
shoppers allowed in stores, as well as higher costs
for cleaning and delivery. McKinsey analyses show
that, without transformation, grocers’ margins
could drop from between 2 percent and 5 percent,
on average, before the onset of the pandemic, to
between 1 percent and 4 percent going forward.
Continued economic pressure could force grocers
to compete on price as they battle for customer
loyalty. For this reason, we believe market share
could partly shift from supermarkets to lower-cost,
more convenient channels, such as mass, clubs,
and discounters. The latter are favorably positioned
based on footprint, format, and digital strength.
Many mass players, for instance, hold sufficient
cash as a percentage of sales, indicating that they
can make the investments necessary to remain
relevant to customers. Clubs are essentially onestop-shops for consumers and track well against
projected reductions in store visits as a result of the
pandemic. Retailers that have natural depth and

breadth of assortment on their shelves (including
unique pack sizes) and in their warehouses are wellpositioned in the case of unforeseen supply shocks.
Because of continuing concerns about COVID-19,
grocers will need to move even more aggressively
into e-commerce and alternative delivery options—
including scan-to-go and contactless payment and
pickup services. Moreover, consumers’ shifting
preferences for food items, including those
pantry items necessary for routine daily cooking,
means that grocery stores will need to continually
re-evaluate their full product mix—in many cases
shifting to fresh, local, and healthy options in line
with consumer trends.
In this environment, grocers may look to reduce
costs (between 10 and 15 percent) by accelerating
digital and automation transformation across
stores and home-office activities; they may be able
to achieve this more quickly by seeking out M&A
and partnerships that can provide the necessary
technical capabilities and skill sets. Partnerships
with manufacturers, for instance, may allow grocers
to offer private-label and exclusive products at more
competitive prices. And tech acquisitions may allow
grocers to leverage analytics (and data scientists)
that can help them understand and react to shifts
in consumer demand and optimize price and
promotional investments.

Making bold moves can help retailers
build and maintain resiliency.

The next normal in retail: Charting a path forward

141

The pathway for AF&L
The AF&L sector is likely to face a sharp decline in
revenue and margins, with a much longer expected
time for recovery than other sectors. Extended
store closures, lagging consumer sentiment, and
financial insecurity are likely to affect the industry
significantly over the next few quarters. Gross
margins will likely be affected by slower-moving
inventory and the need to offer more discounts
and promotions to bring consumers back into the
fold. Cost of goods sold and selling, general, and
administrative expenses may be affected by supplyside constraints, investments in omnichannel
sales, and the need to build health and safety
infrastructures in physical stores. McKinsey
research projects overall revenue losses in this
subsector to be from 20 percent to 45 percent
in 2020, with the potential for a 30 percent to 55
percent rebound in 2021 (with the possibility of
returning to near 2019 levels).
Similar to the grocery subsector, there has been a
marked shift in the AF&L sector toward online or
omnichannel sales, with a projected postpandemic
increase in e-commerce penetration of 10 to 15
percent. Discretionary spending in this category,
however, is expected to drop 50 to 60 percent in the
next normal. To bolster revenues, AF&L companies
may lean even more heavily into omnichannel
services—for instance, improving the customer
purchasing experience online, enhancing delivery
capabilities, or introducing curbside pickup options.
They may introduce personalized content—in which
consumers can customize colors or designs of
certain products—or subscription-based services
to try to regain customer loyalty and establish
reliable revenue flows. When it comes to inventory
forecasting and replenishment, or renegotiating
sourcing agreements, AF&L companies may need to
rethink their existing strategies—perhaps doubling
down on the use of advanced analytics to ensure
agility and flexibility as demand rises and falls in the
next normal.
To bolster margins, AF&L retailers can renegotiate
rents, reduce sourcing and supply expenses, and
economize labor forces and store footprints. They
can use store and labor data to make strategic

142

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

decisions about which stores to reopen, the optimal
number of in-store versus back-end employees, and
the investments required to build out shields, walls,
sanitizing stations, and other elements of safety
infrastructure.
Those AF&L retailers in a stronger liquidity position
may be more aggressive with their M&A programs—
for instance, picking up distressed assets, investing
in new business models, seeking out possibilities
in adjacent markets and channels, or enhancing
their brand capabilities through deals. Retailers in
this category should focus on elevating customerloyalty tactics and programs to keep existing
customers in the fold and planning new marketing
and promotional initiatives to attract new customers
during the recovery phase. They may offer special
promotions on certain product categories, or
apply shopper loyalty points toward services from
attractive new partners.
The pathway for restaurants
The frequency of visits to bars and restaurants
dropped by 50 percent over the past six months,
and our research suggests that restaurants will
continue to experience significant headwinds,
as consumers choose to stay and eat at home.
Continued restrictions will change the way
consumers want to be served. There has been
and will continue to be a shift to e-commerce,
delivery (19 percent increase in consumer adoption
of delivery), ordering through online apps, and
contactless pickup (21 percent increase in
curbside pickup).
Because restaurants have limited real-time
labor flexibility, their labor costs will increase as a
percentage of revenue as revenues decline. Our
research also indicates that margins will decrease
by 50 to 100 basis points, given fixed occupancy
costs—although relief may be possible if real estate
prices go down. Increased costs from new forms
of delivery, contactless payment, and a potential
shift toward lower-margin products will put added
pressure on this segment. Additionally, there will be
a continued increase in expenses related to supplies
and cleaning.

The restaurants that thrived during quarantines
(pizza category), or that were not significantly
affected relative to others (burger and chicken
categories), are obviously best positioned to
rebound. Many have mature technology capabilities
and the liquidity to further invest in new capabilities
that can improve their operations. Others, however,
can accelerate their recovery in the next normal by
using a mix of new channels, offerings, and price
points. Those with primarily eat-in service, for
instance, could expand upon the order-ahead and
delivery models they launched during the pandemic.
They may use partnerships or M&A to quickly build
some of the capabilities required to operate in new
ways—such as advanced analytics to increase
their forecasting, order-taking, and real-time
delivery times.

In the next normal, retailers will need to
transform operations and capabilities along
several dimensions—bolstering digital and other
capabilities, revamping key commercial and revenue
growth management levers (price, promotion,
assortment), rethinking operating models, and
exploring M&A and partnerships. Systematically
assessing the company’s objectives against the
changed landscape and making bold moves
can help retailers build and maintain resiliency
in the next normal and during other crises that
may emerge.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

COVID-19 has exacted a heavy toll on the United
States, claiming lives as well as livelihoods. In
some parts of the country, the public-health crisis
is showing signs of abating—but economic issues
are now starting to take center stage. Consumers
are anxious, and with good reason: extreme
macroeconomic shifts, including a historic rise in
unemployment and a steep decline in GDP, portend
prolonged financial insecurity and economic pain.

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
June 2020.

These developments will fundamentally reshape
how consumers perceive value and seek
affordability in a post–COVID-19 world. Value
perception—the combination of price, quality, and
service by which consumers judge whether they’re
getting a good deal—has long been a major factor
in consumers’ decisions about where to shop; it will
become even more critical as we emerge from the
current crisis.
Analyzing how consumer behavior changed during
previous downturns can give retailers insights
into how to prepare for what comes next. But the
COVID-19 crisis, though similar in some ways to past
economic shocks, has particular nuances that make
it more complex for retailers to navigate. For one,
during neither the Great Depression nor the 2008
recession were consumers homebound for months,
fearing infection simply from being near other
people. Also, COVID-19’s impact to date has varied
greatly across cities and states because of different

rates of virus spread and different levels of localgovernment intervention.
Against this backdrop, retailers will need to be
deliberate about influencing consumers’ value
perception. After all, for many US consumers,
affordability will be the single most important factor
informing purchase decisions. In this article, we
share our perspectives on how retailers can develop
a value strategy that will position them for success in
the next normal.1

US consumers’ top concern:
The economy
Since mid-March, more than 40 million people
across the country have lost their jobs. The
unemployment rate—which hit 14.7 percent in April
before easing to 13.3 percent in May—has soared
to its highest level since the Great Depression and
eclipsed the 10 percent we saw at the peak of the
2008 recession. And the economic uncertainty
affects more than just the jobless: in a McKinsey
survey conducted May 18–24, nearly half of
US consumers reported cutting back on their
spending. Just under two-thirds said they are
“very” or “extremely” concerned about the national
economy—making it the number-one concern of
survey respondents.2 Americans are now more
worried about the economy than about their health
and safety (Exhibit 1).

When asked why they started buying
more private-label goods, 44 percent
of consumers cited affordability and
better value.

Several states have eased restrictions, in an effort
to jump-start their economies, but it will take
time before consumer confidence and spending
return to precrisis levels. More than two-thirds of
survey respondents believe the pandemic will have
an impact on their financial situation for at least
another two months; 30 percent foresee the impact
lasting until early 2021 or beyond. (For the latest US
consumer-sentiment survey findings, visit McKinsey.
com/coronavirus.)

A classic economic crisis … with a twist
Early indications suggest that the changes in
consumer behavior during the COVID-19 crisis
will largely mirror the changes that manifested
themselves during the 2008 recession—but with
some unique nuances. We’ve observed, for instance,
the familiar flight to value: our recent research

146

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

shows that 34 percent of consumers have increased
their spending on private-label products during
the pandemic and that most of those consumers
plan to continue doing so even after the crisis has
passed. When asked why they started buying more
private-label goods, 44 percent cited affordability
and better value.
The current crisis, similar to the 2008 recession, has
thrown off many consumers’ traditional shopping
cadence. Take grocery shopping: in the early days
of the pandemic, consumers loaded their pantries,
made fewer shopping trips, visited fewer stores each
week, and targeted their spending on essentials.
Consumers have also tried new retailers and new
brands during the crisis, possibly shifting the loyalty
dynamics within the retail sector (Exhibit 2).

But the COVID-19 crisis, unlike past economic
disruptions, brings a new layer of complexity: the
severe threat to consumers’ health and safety.
Consequently, the pandemic has amplified and
accelerated the consumer behavior we’ve seen
in times of crisis. For example, during the 2008
recession, financially strapped consumers
drastically reduced their spending on out-of-home
dining. But during this pandemic, restaurant dining
has come to a standstill as physical distancing
and stay-at-home orders in many regions forced
consumers to eat practically all their meals at home.

Redefining value and affordability in retail’s next normal

In addition, some retail trends that we expected
to unfold over several years have now taken
hold in a matter of weeks. Digital and alternative
fulfillment models (such as curbside pickup), which
some retailers previously viewed as experimental,
suddenly became must-haves. In US grocery,
e-commerce penetration was a mere 3 percent
before the crisis and is expected to reach 8 to
10 percent this year. Because online grocery
typically comes with steep price markups, as well as
delivery fees and tips, we expect demand to soften
as consumers’ financial considerations begin to
outweigh their health concerns. Already, consumers

147

are predicting that after the crisis they’ll prioritize
affordability when deciding where to shop (Exhibit 3).
E-commerce penetration in grocery will likely dip back
down to between 5 and 6 percent postcrisis.
Furthermore, the impact of COVID-19 hasn’t been
uniform across the country, because of differences
in both virus spread and government regulation.
Geographic variability in consumer sentiment is
therefore likely to persist and potentially even
widen—which means that retailers will need to vary
their value strategies by region.

How to shape value perception in the
next normal
Since consumers will increasingly look for value and
affordability, retailers must offer a convincing value
message to succeed in the next normal. They will, of
course, still have the classic value communications,
pricing, and promotional tools at their disposal, but
they must deploy these tools in new ways.
Every retailer will also need to reassess its entire
value strategy—reevaluating both products and
services—to ensure alignment with consumers’
new need states.
For food, mass, convenience, and drug retailers in
particular, we recommend the following six actions.
1. Develop a value strategy for each
consumer segment.
In light of economic uncertainty, the general
consensus is that value will matter—but there
is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all approach
to maintaining or improving consumer value
perception. There are, of course, no-regret moves:
look to “recession-proof” your assortment by
doubling down on private label and ensure that
you have a robust set of opening price points in
each category.
With the significant shift away from off-premise
food consumption, you need a multipronged
strategy to address what affordability means to your
most important customers. For example, consumers
under intense financial pressure will seek out
grocers that offer compelling price points on the
approximately 1,000 essential SKUs that consumers

148

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

purchase most often (which are typically SKUs that
both traditional grocers and small-box discounters
carry). Conversely, more-affluent consumers might
be less price sensitive but may look to grocers to
provide substitutes for needs typically fulfilled
elsewhere, such as eating out or entertainment. To
appeal to these consumers, consider highlighting
premium items (such as gourmet chocolates, fine
wines, and international cheeses) or enhanced
services (such as ready-to-eat meals and home
delivery), especially since these tend to be less
expensive alternatives to restaurant dining and can
therefore help drive value perception while also
pushing up average price points.
2. Localize your value levers.
Given the variability in COVID-19’s impact across
the country, adjust your pricing, promotions, and
assortments to best serve local communities.

Boldly exploring innovative tactics in
promotions, pricing, and assortment
will be paramount for responding to the
changing needs of your consumer base.
restrictions, for example, may respond better
to value messaging around pantry loading and
at-home eating. In states that have already
eased restrictions, you might instead capitalize
on the pent-up demand for out-of-home dining
by introducing new products and services that
compete with restaurants.
Account for new market dynamics and determine who
your true competitors are in the post–COVID-19 world.
We expect a wide range of competitive responses,
including stronger opening price points and new
services (such as free delivery) to meet local needs—
all of which will require close attention at a regional
level. A broad approach to value and affordability
will be less effective than a targeted, localized one.
3. Build agility into your commercial activities.
While the pandemic’s peak may be behind us, the
shape of the recovery is still difficult to predict.
Agility—the ability to respond rapidly to changes in
consumer sentiment and value perception—will be
crucial. As part of building agility, you will need to
monitor carefully chosen metrics that are reliable
indicators of how consumers are thinking about
price and value, such as e-commerce penetration,
basket size, and private-label penetration. Consider
supplementing commercial levers that have long
lead times (for instance, print circulars and TV
advertising) with levers that allow for immediate
adjustments (such as digital circulars, in-store
product pricing, and store displays and promotions).
Also, maintain connectivity to broader trends in
the business. By accessing real-time data on the
inventory availability of “spiky” items such as toilet
paper and cleaning supplies, for example, you’ll be

Redefining value and affordability in retail’s next normal

able to adjust the timing of promotions based on
availability, instead of disappointing your customers.
Boldly exploring innovative tactics in promotions,
pricing, and assortment will be paramount for
responding to the changing needs of your
consumer base.
4. Update your value communication for the
postcrisis context.
Given the shifts in consumer behavior—more
cooking at home, larger baskets, less crossshopping across retailers—each shopping
occasion, for loyal and new customers alike, takes
on greater importance for retailers. Find new
ways to communicate and deliver value. First,
use your unique value proposition as a base for
value communications, expanding beyond purely
communicating price points. Highlight the areas
in which you are best positioned relative to your
competitors, whether that’s the broadest privatelabel offering, the freshest produce, or the best
shopping experience.
Additionally, consider launching new product
offerings to serve COVID-19–related occasions.
For example, advertising a single, attentiongetting price for the ingredients for a family meal
(“Feed the family for $15”), instead of promoting
individual items, may resonate with parents who
have been cooking multiple times a day for the
past two months. Presenting indulgent purchases
as replacements for products and services from
nontraditional competitors (for instance, billing a
popcorn-and-candy deal for an at-home movie
night as a substitute for going to a movie theater)
could be attractive to shoppers seeking affordable
entertainment. Relevant and empathetic messaging

149

that avoids tone-deaf references—such as
references to fancy dinner parties or large social
events—will help consumers continue to view your
stores as a trusted resource in a time of need.
As your consumer value proposition evolves,
your relationships with vendors and your tradeinvestment decisions should evolve as well. With
many annual promotional plans disrupted, choices
about how to allocate funding and what new
avenues to invest in (digital channels, for instance)
will become more important.
5. Define value-perception triggers to help guide
rapid decision making.
Identifying specific customer and competitor triggers
up front can equip you to make decisions quickly
and to execute more effectively. To illustrate: many
retailers are currently debating whether or not to
expand shelf space for private-label products. Instead
of trying to predict customer demand, agreeing on a
specific trigger—for example, the growth of privatelabel share by more than five percentage points in
a given category—can provide clarity and help the
business respond rapidly to consumer trends.
Define similar triggers with regard to the supply chain
(for example, resuming promotional activity when
out of stocks return to normal levels), competitor
dynamics (repricing the top 20 key value items when
competitors reduce prices on them by a certain
percentage), and customer loyalty (sending “best
customer” coupons to customers when the number
of their shopping trips per month falls below a certain

level). Attempts to define value-perception triggers in
real time often devolve into chaos and can lead to illadvised tactics, such as running promotions on items
that are already out of stock. Set up these triggers
now to be ready for a variety of scenarios.
This will be particularly important if you rely on a
high level of promotional intensity to drive value
perception and, ultimately, customer choice. In the
next normal, you may find such an approach to be
incompatible with consumer needs and opt for a
different approach instead (such as everyday low
pricing on select items and categories).
6. Upgrade your tools and organization.
Analytics, consumer insights, and systems play a
central role in delivering impact through commercial
levers. In the wake of this crisis, you will almost
certainly need to enhance current tools and build
new capabilities, such as automated reporting to
track consumer responses, and systems that can
deploy localized store-level promotions.
With many retailers forced to close stores and
furlough employees, consider hiring new talent for
your most critical functions (such as e-commerce
and digital). New work-from-home norms could also
open up talent pools across the country and beyond.
Reevaluate build-versus-buy decisions regarding
tool deployment in the context of COVID-19, since
the pandemic may have changed the factors that
influence those decisions.

Identifying specific customer and
competitor triggers up front can
equip you to make decisions quickly
and to execute more effectively.

While no one can say for sure how the next normal
will play out, it’s becoming clear that economic
uncertainty and shifts in consumer behavior—both
mandated and voluntary—will reshape the retail
landscape. By reexamining core merchandising
strategies and tools, tailoring them appropriately

to the new environment, and deploying them in
innovative ways, retailers can offer the value and
affordability that consumers will seek in the post–
COVID-19 world.

This article first

McKinsey.com in
April 2020.

As a global pandemic, COVID-19 poses mindboggling health and humanitarian challenges, and
the economic impact on lives and livelihoods of
the efforts to contain the virus is the strongest in
a century.
Retail is one of the sectors most affected by
COVID-19, in both positive and negative ways.
Grocers, pharmacies, and e-commerce marketplaces are sustaining consumer access to
essentials—food, medication, toiletries, and
selected “at home” categories—while striving to
protect customers, employees, and suppliers.
At the same time, store closures and sharp declines
in discretionary consumer spending have crippled
nonessential retail (other non-food, apparel, fashion,
and luxury products). Many retailers have already
had to make tough choices, including temporarily or
permanently closing doors, furloughing employees,
and more.
Despite this challenging environment, analyses of
past crises have shown that there is still potential for
value creation through M&A across industries; for
further detail, please see the recent cross-industry
article, “The power of through-cycle M&A.”
This article examines trends that are likely to create
M&A and partnership opportunities that may enable
retailers, brands, and investors to shape the next
normal postcrisis.

Impact of COVID-19 on the retail sector
Across the globe, consumers plan to reduce
short-term and mid-term spending, especially in
nonessential categories. Consumer intent, of course,
varies by individual economic situation and outlook.
For more detail analysis of consumer sentiment,
please see McKinsey’s global survey of consumer
sentiment during the coronavirus crisis.
Shift to online and digital purchasing. As
shelter-in-place orders proliferate and potentially
extend, and consumer anxiety about infection
persists, consumers across age groups have already
shifted spend to online channels. The longer the

The next normal: Retail M&A and partnerships after COVID-19

crisis lasts, the greater the likelihood that online and
omnichannel purchasing will become the next normal.
While this shift is pronounced in grocery and other
essential categories, the channel shift within apparel,
fashion, and luxury (AF&L) brands and retailers has
not come close to making up for the lost brick-andmortar sales as our recent article on the impact of
COVID-19 on the sector demonstrates.
Across both AF&L and food, drug, and massmerchandise (FD&M) players, the shift in consumer
spending to online will pose a question about the
future—and purpose—of their brick-and-mortar
locations. Driving unique in-store experiences
will become even more critical than it has been
to drive traffic, facilitate the omni-experience, and
improve profitability.
Healthy, safe, and local. One of the biggest
challenges facing retailers is the need to protect
customers and employees from contracting or
spreading COVID-19. Concerns about health and
safety have never loomed larger for stakeholders
across the value chain. The retailers with the highest
degree of touchless automation, both in stores
and in warehouses, may enjoy a clear competitive
advantage, as they face lower risk to consumers,
employees, and their overall operations. Increasing
focus on improving health, paired with increased
demand for fresh food could drive longer-term
habits focused on healthy lifestyle and nutrition.
Shift to value for money. As in any economic
downturn, a postcrisis downturn will probably lead
consumers to demand value for money across
retail sectors. This is already happening in essential
categories, as private-label sales at grocers
and pharmacies are increasing, and pricing and
promotion strategies are emphasizing value. In the
AF&L sector, recent analysis indicates bifurcation of
the market with respect to price positioning.
Flexibility of labor. The COVID-19 crisis
underscores the need for more flexible resource
allocation that deploys labor across a broader range
of activities. This could accelerate the move toward
more agile and dynamic resourcing from stores to
distribution centers to corporate offices. It could

153

Despite this challenging environment,
analyses of past crises have shown that
there is still potential for value creation
through M&A across industries

drive new models of collaboration between retailers
and their stakeholders to address scarce capabilities
and enable the labor pool to move more fluidly in
order to meet demand across priority activities.
Loyalty shock. Scarcity of products has spurred
trial of new brands, as customers trade up and
down. In Asia and the United States, but less so in
Europe, we have seen store and brand switching
due to proximity, availability, ease of use, and safety
considerations, creating opportunities for new habit
creation. In the United States in particular, many
consumers stated they have tried store or generic
brands for the first time, with many saying they were
satisfied with the product and would purchase again.

Retail M&A during and after
the COVID-19 crisis
Before COVID-19, we observed four primary deal
archetypes, though this sector did not see as much
deal activity as other sectors. Analysis of more than
900 global retail M&A deals over the last ten years
suggested the following archetypes (Exhibit 1):
1.

like-for-like acquisitions, that is, the purchase
of direct competitor, who plays in the same
categories and/or channels and serving similar
consumers, with the goal of gaining scale and
unlocking cost synergies

2. category or channel expansion, that is, buying
into a new category or channel with the goal of
improving growth exposure and/or broadening
the product offering to the consumer

154

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

3. new business models and/or adjacencies,
typically deployed in a bid to vertically integrate
up or down the value chain with the purpose to
increase scale and/or control in the supply chain
to strengthen the specific value proposition of
the retailer
4. capabilities, that is, targets that offer new
platforms, tools or know-how and talent (typically
back end, not consumer facing) to enhance value
proposition and service to the end consumer
Historically, archetype 1 (in which the retailer or
brand buys a like business, usually to gain scale
or share) drove most of the deal value. However,
since the 2008 recession, we have seen “new
business model” acquisitions (archetype 3)
gradually increase over time. Deals to acquire
new channels or categories (archetype 2) and
capabilities (archetype 4) have also increased, but
not as aggressively. Analysis of the impact of total
shareholder returns (TSR) across deal archetypes
finds shareholders responding most positively to
archetypes 1 and 4. Across the more than 600 (nonAF&L) deals we surveyed, TSR for archetype 1 deals
increased 2 percent, and TSR for archetype 4 deals
increased 6 percent post-announcement. The other
archetypes saw lower value creation, potentially
reflecting questions about the wide variance in P&L
economics of the e-commerce channel and new
business models.
Given changes in consumer spending across
channels as well as persistent concerns about

health and safety, and despite the weaker economic
outlook, we expect retail M&A activity to accelerate
as the crisis stabilizes. Consolidation of smaller
players, acquisition of new business models, and
capability tuck-ins (such as archetypes 1, 3, and 4)
are likely to increase as financially sound retailers
and industry stakeholders uncover opportunities.
Within this context, players have new license to
rethink their M&A strategy.

The next normal: Retail M&A and partnerships after COVID-19

Taking learnings from the last recession, retailers
that can continue to make organic and inorganic
investments through a down cycle typically
outperform competitors over the long term.
Companies that outperformed during the last
recession participated in 10 percent more deals
and in larger deals (approximately 1.8 times higher
median) than companies that did not outperform.

that companies that take M&A action early may
also benefit from more favorable valuations at first
(Exhibit 2).
In the new COVID-19 context not all retailers will
be equipped to pursue M&A. The most likely
are the leading ecosystems and larger FD&M
companies with strong e-commerce positions that
focus on essentials or well-performing brands,
play in subsectors less affected by the crisis, and
enjoy some combination of relatively low financial
leverage, access to investment-grade debt, and a
cash-heavy balance sheet.

Smaller, more specialty players are less likely to
flourish, as they are more often weakly capitalized
and may lack the breadth and depth of e-commerce
capabilities—or the financial muscle to build them—
required to profit in the short to medium term from
shifts in consumer spending. These players may
become targets for more resilient competitors.
Private equity (PE) may also play a key role in
accelerating M&A activity postcrisis. At the beginning
of 2020, the global private-equity industry had an
estimated $1.5 trillion in dry powder,1 and it likely will
be key player in the overall retail M&A landscape.

Implications for food, drug, and massmerchandise players
Because FD&M retailers are deemed essential in
most markets, they have both obligations and often
advantages during the COVID-19 crisis. They have a
social imperative to improve their productivity to meet
broad humanitarian needs, and they are currently
some of the few retailers taking in cash, while also
seeing firsthand the shifts in consumer behavior,
spending patterns, and channel preferences.
We expect FD&M deal or collaboration activity to
increase across all archetypes, but especially new
business models and adjacencies (archetype 3) and
capabilities (archetype 4).
Roll-ups of smaller regional or independent
FD&M players (archetype 1) may accelerate in 2021,
as these retailers face sustained sales declines
driven by consumers shifting to alternative channels
or players with stronger omnichannel offerings. This
may create opportunities for the largest retailers to
expand their geographic reach and generate backend synergies. It is less likely this will occur in the
short term as nearly all grocers have seen a spike
in sales that is expected to persist through the end
of 2020; potential sales declines driven by pantry
unloading may not occur until 2021 depending on
how long COVID-19 crisis lasts. In the short term,
this roll-up may manifest as purchase of assets,
particularly well-priced prime retail locations.
Acquisitions to expand into new categories or
channels (archetype 2) may be smart plays for
FD&M retailers, especially as they prepare for the
next normal postcrisis and face lower in-store
traffic. Broadening category footprint, that is,
moving into complementary categories, could
enhance players’ value propositions and increase
in-store traffic. Other opportunities in food service
may also materialize, as some food service players
(for example, quick-service-restaurant players) face
financial difficulties. However, this expansion will
be tempered by a need to simplify and strengthen
supply chains; perhaps only where acquisitions are
natural extensions of existing assortment and does
not inhibit the agility of the supply chain.

The next normal: Retail M&A and partnerships after COVID-19

Traditional FD&M and pure-play e-commerce
players may move opportunistically into
adjacencies (archetype 3) to integrate vertically
and strengthen their route to market. Attractive
options may include delivery services to capitalize
on the anticipated stickiness of e-commerce and
omnichannel buying and vertical integration of
suppliers to guarantee availability and control
over strategic categories. Other downstream
opportunities in food service may materialize as
some players face financial pressures.
FD&M players may double down on the
acquisition of digital capabilities, platforms,
and other value-adding bolt-ons (archetype 4)
to enhance and transform existing operations
quickly, given the relatively strong performance
and persistent demonstration of touchless use
cases. These deals will capitalize on evolving
technology, secure scarce capabilities, and meet
postcrisis service needs. For example, we expect
that FD&M retailers will increasingly look to
invest in automation technology (for both in store
and back end), analytical tools and capabilities,
e-commerce platform-management opportunities,
and last-mile technology tools to pull forward
digital transformation. This could also manifest via
collaborations with logistics providers.
Implications for AF&L players
The past five years have favored a few AF&L
success stories and left a long tail of lowerperforming companies. Most AF&L companies (62
percent) saw negative TSR (versus 21 percent of the
S&P 500), and only 15 percent of AF&L companies
achieved TSR greater than 10 percent (versus 46
percent of the S&P 500).
Today, several AF&L categories (for example,
footwear, apparel, and jewelry) are some of the
retail categories hardest hit by the crisis. We expect
AF&L M&A and partnerships could evolve in three
ways postcrisis, accelerating some of the trends
described in our latest State of Fashion outlook
beyond COVID-19.

157

Purchases of brands or retailers (archetype 1).
Strategic acquirers and PE investors may look to
revitalize or own and license longstanding brands
that become distressed but are believed to retain
strong brand value. Strong brands that acquirers
can leverage to build out unique business models
may be especially attractive targets. As with FD&M,
in the short term, some of this could manifest as
asset sales, particularly as challenged brands and
retailers look for injections of cash.
Further consolidation into existing or new “brand
houses” (archetype 1). Relatively cash-safe AF&L
players and PE or other private investors may
look to combine multiple brands in a portfolio and
give them creative autonomy, while realizing cost
benefits from jointly negotiated rents, wholesaler
terms, and back-office cost synergies.
Partnership with small players (archetypes 2–4)
and platform and marketplace consolidation.
The combination of an expected downturn and
below-expectation performance in recent deals
to exit direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands (for
example, Casper IPO) could lead to more cautious
funding of AF&L-focused DTC players, at least in
the short term. This may open the door for strategic
purchases of high-growth-oriented brands and
retailers that have the digitally focused operations
and consumer bases required for growth. Brands
and multibrand players could also look to take
smaller platforms in house to enhance consumer
reach and digital capability. Overall, we expect
the crisis to lead to further consolidation of
marketplaces and platforms.

Next steps for retailers
COVID-19 and the onset of an economic slowdown
may well reshape the landscape of retail deals
and partnerships. We encourage retailers to take
four steps now as they contemplate M&A and
partnerships going forward, grounded in the three
C’s of excellent M&A strategists (competitive
advantage, capacity, and conviction).

158

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

Define the next normal—and your competitive
advantage. The first step to redefining M&A and
partnership strategy is to understand what the next
normal means for each brand and retailer. The new
reality will depend largely on how core consumer
segments, including behaviors and spending
habits, have been impacted by COVID-19. Where
are the growth spaces today and where will they
be in the future? Where are consumers spending
money—which categories and/or channels? How
have their tastes, preferences, or concerns changed,
driving new opportunities for differentiation or
shaping new habits? In this context, how have
previous competitive advantages changed and what
new advantages have emerged? Identifying the
opportunities for growth in the next normal—and
which areas can be accelerated via partnerships
and M&A—will be the first step to reshaping M&A
strategy.
Assess capacity to execute acquisitions and
partnerships. A realistic assessment of balancesheet strength and ability to make acquisitions
independently (that is, while debt markets are
slowed or frozen), as well as ability to secure
financing in the postcrisis environment, will be a
key input to evolving M&A strategy. Understanding
what targets (and what size targets) are feasible to
acquire now versus later should inform how areas of
exploration are prioritized. For players with limited
cash availability or challenging financial health,
partnerships with other players to pool financial
resources while addressing strategic priorities could
be considered (for example, sourcing collaborations).
Build conviction through identification of
key areas of exploration within the M&A and
partnership market and think through value
creation up front. Retailers should generate
data-backed perspectives about market trajectory,
new-normal scenarios postcrisis, and the risks of
further disruption. Shortlisting top-priority areas
and securing executive and board commitment to

M&A will accelerate decision making as markets
thaw and potential targets are discovered. In the
post-COVID-19 tight credit market, we expect that
synergy capture expectations, and track record,
will matter to investors, which makes it even more
important to think through synergy ambitions and
value-capture plans up front. We also envision that a
potential economic crisis will make it more important
to carefully think through how a deal can help to
sharpen and/or reposition the joint entity’s value
proposition(s) to better service customers’ needs.
Explore opportunities to strike new deals and
partner with healthier players. Players without
the cash and financial health to pursue acquisitions
should identify potential assets to liquidate or
potential partnerships to shore up the balance sheet

until the crisis passes. The implications of COVID-19
are just as high for potential sellers as they are for
potential acquirers.

The retail sector cannot escape the economic
impact of COVID-19. But, despite the difficult
economic outlook, we expect retail M&A activity
to accelerate as the crisis stabilizes, creating
opportunities for financially sound players to acquire
or partner with less advantaged players. Now is
the time for retailers to think about M&A postcrisis.
This calls for defining their role in the next normal,
reevaluating financial health, segmenting the M&A
market, and contemplating new deals
and partnerships.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the retail
industry, forcing the closure of physical stores
and causing uncertainty for the future of the
in-store experience. These abrupt shifts have
left many retailers scrambling to effectively serve
customers through other channels. Digital-first
and omnichannel retailers have pivoted more
easily, but retailers that prioritized physical stores
and face-to-face engagement over omnichannel
strategies have struggled to respond.

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
May 2020.

For retailers, the starting point matters in a crisis.
Organizations that can quickly reimagine their
omnichannel approach to create a distinctive
customer experience will recover faster from
the pandemic. Analysis of the financial crisis of
2008 shows that customer experience leaders saw
a shallower downturn, rebounded more rapidly,
and achieved three times the total shareholder
returns in the long run compared with the market
average (Exhibit 1).
The pandemic has changed consumer behaviors,
McK

permanently.¹ We have seen a consolidation

of shopping trips: in China, for example, the number
of transactions in grocery declined by 30 percent
during the pandemic, while the average value per
transaction increased by 69 percent. In the United
States, e-commerce availability and hygiene
considerations are increasing store switching
behavior, with 17 percent of consumers shifting
away from their primary store. Many customers
have also tried new omnichannel models: buy online,
pick up in store (BOPIS) grew 28 percent yearover-year in February compared with 18 percent in
January, and grocery delivery is up by 57 percent.²
More important, many of these new engagement
models are here to stay. Consumers report high
intention to continue using models such as BOPIS
(56 percent) and grocery delivery (45 percent) after
the pandemic.
To remain relevant in this changed environment,
retailers should set a North Star to guide their
aspirations for customer experience, with specific
goals across five actions: double down on
digital, inject innovation into omnichannel,
transform store operations and win on “SafeX,”

How retailers can meet new customer
expectations

Looking forward, we believe retailers should focus
on five actions to build more resilience in their
customer experience and to emerge even stronger
in the recovery.

The savviest retailers have spent years creating
omnichannel strategies that blend physical and
online channels to engage consumers in the
channel of their choosing. COVID-19’s impact
on customer behavior has reshuffled the deck.
In-person interaction has dramatically changed
or been supplanted by digital engagement, and
early indications suggest that much of this shift
may endure in the long term. E-commerce sales in
apparel, department stores, and beauty products
have increased by nearly ten percentage points, on
average, since the onset of the pandemic. In grocery,
e-commerce penetration, which has risen from 2 to

1. Double down on digital
COVID-19 has dramatically and suddenly shifted
more customer traffic to digital channels. Consider
that online sales, which increased at a 14 percent
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the
past four years, grew by 25 percent in a two-week
period in March 2020—led by grocery purchases.3
The profound impact of the pandemic on consumer
shopping habits has increased the urgency for
retailers to expand their digital presence quickly.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

Dial up the acquisition engine and drive traffic
to digital assets. Retailers can partially offset
diminished foot traffic in physical stores by boosting
investments in online acquisition. This effort will
require them to reallocate funds from offline media
to digital channels. With more investment in online
marketing, winners are adapting their strategies
to account for shifts in consumer behavior. These
adaptations include paying closer attention to paid
search (for example, looking at not just keyword
performance but also consumer intent) and
improving the “shoppability” of social channels (for
example, through featured products and clickable
content on Instagram).
Extend digital-channel presence and engagement.
Shelter-in-place orders have led companies to
test new methods of customer engagement. App
downloads increased 11 percent from January to April
2020 compared with the same period last year. Many
retailers with established mobile apps have cited
record downloads, while others sought to make up
ground quickly. Around 45 to 50 percent of retailers
had plans to prioritize a mobile app or point-of-sale
experience this year, and several companies have
accelerated their efforts in response to the pandemic.
In addition, while building and nurturing online
communities are not new ideas, they have gained
momentum. Retailers are augmenting direct
customer interactions with engagement in apps and
other relevant channels. Nike China, for example,
activated its digital community by offering virtual
workouts and saw an 80 percent increase in weekly
active users of its app.
Ensure that the digital experience is truly “zero
friction.” Customer expectations are rising for
digital channels along measures such as site
speed, stability, and delivery times. To keep pace,
retailers should start by designing web pages that
are optimized for digital shopping. For example,
making the highest-selling (and ideally highest-

4
5

margin) products easy to find helps to make the
customer journey more seamless. The first page
of Amazon listings receives nearly two-thirds of all
product clicks.⁴ Increasing load speed to best-inclass levels is also paramount: the ideal load time
for peak conversions is no more than 2.7 seconds
(and every 100-millisecond delay above that can
reduce conversion by up to 7 percent⁵). Additional
priorities include high-functioning landing pages
and consistent marketing messages. With more
customers now engaging through mobile devices,
retailers must ensure that all digital channels are
integrated and offer consistent services (such
as payment options) and experiences (such as
shopping carts updated in real time across devices).
2. Inject innovation into omnichannel
To adapt to new customer behaviors and
preferences, retailers will need to evaluate
their current omnichannel offerings and find
opportunities to innovate and fill gaps. Any
additions should be clearly aligned with emerging
customer needs and integrated with existing
channels to support a consistent experience.
Bring an in-store feel to the digital experience.
The inability to engage customers in a physical
environment has pushed some retailers to bring
more of the in-store experience online (Exhibit 3).
First, leading retailers have substituted in-store
personalized interaction with offerings such as
virtual appointments, where sales associates
use videoconferencing platforms to offer
personalized attention to customers. Sales agents
help individuals find products that meet their
needs while learning ways to better serve
customers online. Similarly, retailers are using
livestreaming to engage with customers and
increase revenue and loyalty by sharing experiential
content. In China, for example, Taobao Live made
it easier for brick-and-mortar retailers to join its
livestreaming channel platform, leading to a
719 percent increase in participating merchants

Trained staff can create content that addresses

promoting current products and new launches.
Second, retailers have been developing alternative
engagement models to de-risk digital-purchasing
decisions. In apparel and fashion, for example,
one of the main impediments to online purchasing
has historically been the inability for customers
to see how items would look on them. Jewelry
brand Kendra Scott is tackling that problem by
launching a new platform, Virtual Try-On, which
uses augmented-reality (AR), machine-learning,
and computer-vision techniques. Launched in
April in response to COVID-19, the platform
allows shoppers to preview styles as they move,
enjoying the experience of a retail setting in the
comfort of their home. Shopify, which allows its
merchants to add 3-D models to their product
pages, found that conversion rates increased by
250 percent when consumers viewed 3-D products
in AR.⁷

Activate
and nurture the
digital community

Launch or diversify delivery mechanisms.
COVID-19 has heightened the importance of
safe delivery modes, including curbside pickup
and aggregator delivery: around 22 percent of
US consumers are using delivery services more
than they were before the crisis. Retailers have
scrambled to launch services to meet this demand.
One retailer that aligned speed and consumer
expectations was Panera. In just two weeks, the
company conceived, developed, and launched a
grocery-delivery service that enables customers
to order entrees from the core business and add
groceries to a unified online cart. And when the
company’s cafes began to close in response to stayat-home orders, Panera moved quickly to launch
curbside ordering and pickup within two weeks.
Retailers are also reassessing store formats to
support third-party delivery services. One grocer is
creating “speed zones” near the front of the store
and stocking them with the most popular items to
enable delivery companies to accelerate pick, pack,
and delivery of orders.

Partner across retail to enhance convenience.
Many retailers have explored strategic partnerships
to enhance convenience for customers and boost
sales. These ecosystems can be quite powerful,
allowing retailers to gain access to new capabilities
and extend their brand reach to new customers in
new places. Footwear retailer DSW, for example,
has partnered with grocery chain Hy-Vee to offer
products through the grocer’s extensive network
of physical locations. Such arrangements give
retailers access to new shopping occasions and new
customers, and can extend one retailer’s brand halo
to its partners.
3. Transform store operations and win on ‘SafeX’
The pandemic has hobbled traditional store
operations, with physical distancing and a new
preference for self-service altering the formula
for customer experience. The priority for many
customers today is to get in and out of a store as
quickly and safely as possible—if they choose to
go in at all (Exhibit 4). Providing safe(r) experiences,
SafeX, will be critical to alleviating customers’
anxieties and enabling a return to in-person
interactions.
McK
2020 In China, for example, 65 percent

of consumers indicated that they expect to care
more about product safety after COVID-19 than
prior to COVID-19.⁸ Retailers must implement
policies and processes to enable safe distances,
sanitize surfaces and products, and communicate
proactively, clearly, and empathetically.
Beyond managing the SafeX considerations
that are currently top of mind, retailers need to
dramatically reduce costs and improve operational
efficiency in their stores to offset revenues that
are increasingly shifting to online channels.⁹ Done
properly, this effort will help companies enhance
customer experience and safety while trimming
operating expenses.
Retailers can start by establishing a set of service
and experience elements that are nonnegotiable.
New safety requirements for both customers
and associates will be a core part of these
nonnegotiables and could include no-contact
payment methods or cleaning and employeehygiene processes. The workforce will need
to be redirected from less-relevant activities to
priority areas. Many of the opportunities can

be captured quickly by changing store hours,
improving scheduling, and altering the mix of
full- and part-time employees. Some retailers have
started to move certain elements of the experience
outside of the store (for example, returns in
the parking lot), given limits on customers per
square foot in stores. A structured effort focused
on addressing new operational needs and
implementing leaner practices can yield labor
efficiencies of 5 to 15 percent.
For retailers that have closed stores during the
pandemic, the reopening process offers an
opportunity to establish new models. First and
foremost, physical-distancing requirements will
likely constrain the number of employees who can
be in stores at the same time. These limitations
could force retailers to prioritize activities such
as opening and closing processes, checkout,
restocking, and e-commerce fulfillment. Store
reopenings will also offer retailers an opportunity
to fundamentally change how core processes are
carried out and implement best practices.
4. Reimagine the physical network
Over the past three years, consumers have
shifted an increasing share of their purchases
to e-commerce, which has led to ever-growing

declines in physical store traffic. COVID-19 has
accelerated this trend with apparel retailers and
department stores, which are projected to see
a 10 to 13 percent increase in online penetration
after COVID-19. The rising volume of e-commerce
transactions will force retailers to reevaluate their
network of brick-and-mortar stores and how
physical locations can best support the customer
experience.
While physical stores are critical to the customer
experience, our analysis suggests that the United
States has more retail shopping capacity than other
countries with sizable retail markets. Retailers
should be thoughtful about which stores they
choose to reopen and in which sequence.
Optimize the footprint. Sophisticated retailers are
evolving how they evaluate stores and optimize their
network. For example, cutting-edge data sources
can be used to get a detailed view of micro traffic
patterns. Retailers should also adjust their analysis
for the impact of COVID-19 and determine if store
performance is the result of underlying intrinsics
or just the physical store location. Last, four-wall
profitability should be a comprehensive and holistic
measure that takes into account the cross-channel
sales contribution of the store (see sidebar, “Taking

Taking a comprehensive, data-driven approach to store closures

Redefine the role of physical stores. The pandemic
has pushed retailers to move beyond the traditional
view that physical locations are primarily for in-store
customer engagement. Promising new models
have begun to take hold and will continue to evolve
in particular for stores that have high strategic
importance for the retailer’s network. We will likely
see a continuation of the pre-crisis trend toward
retail stores that create immersive experiences to
drive foot traffic. Retailers are also experimenting

long-running trend in the restaurant industry. In
this model, which has been deployed by many
retailers, physical locations are turned into
temporary or permanent fulfillment nodes to
enable faster delivery.
Create the store of the future. The evolution of the
physical store’s role as a core component of the
omnichannel journey has also affected store layouts.
Many retailers had been using their stores to
educate consumers on product offerings, reinforce
their brand’s positioning, and support e-commerce
sales. Indeed, research before the pandemic found
that opening a new location increases traffic to
the retailer’s website by 37 percent the following
quarter.¹⁰ New technology solutions are also
changing store formats: tech-enabled stores, such
as Amazon Go locations, feature new models that
support customer journeys. Sales associates remain

critical to the experience at these stores but play
more of an advocate role for customers. Retailers
will have to rebalance these elements to reflect the
postcrisis constraints.
5. Embrace an agile operating model
The pace of change in the post-pandemic
environment will force retailers to continually
reassess their strategies. This approach requires
more real-time insights on customers as well as
a new agile operating model to harness these
insights and put them into action.
Before the pandemic, digital leaders were using
data to optimize customer experience, gauge
satisfaction, identify foot traffic trends, and
generate purchase recommendations. Winning
retailers are moving beyond surveys as a mechanism
for customer input and toward near-real-time
tracking of consumer trends and behavior shifts.
With the rise of digital in recent months, companies
will have even more dynamic data at their fingertips,
and they can use these data to extract immediate
insights. For example, many retailers have seen
an influx of new customers to physical stores (for
essential retail) or digital channels. Winners will
generate insights from these new customers and
construct targeted retention plans, messages,

11

168

and offers to maintain the customer relationship in
this era of brand switching and cost consciousness.
Social media is another channel that offers insights
on rapidly changing consumer behaviors. For
example, one Chinese rental-car company created a
team to monitor social media and identify real-time
trends. The company then created new offers based
on insights from the social media analysis.
In addition, as retailers reformulate their customer
experience, they should bring customers into the
design process to share feedback as ideas develop,
ensure new offerings are meeting actual needs,
and de-risk initiatives along the way. Qualitative
feedback can be gathered through online tools
or in-person concept sprints so ideas can be
assessed and iteratively improved.
By adopting agile practices alongside the
generation of real-time consumer insights, retailers
can more quickly recalibrate their business model
and offerings to meet consumer expectations.¹¹
Retailers need to raise their metabolic rate—
that is, the speed at which they process information
and develop new offerings. The speed at which
some retailers have been able to stand up new

a truly agile operating model can unleash. A rapid
approach to tests and trials can enable retailers
to launch offerings at scale more quickly and
avoid losing share in the face of shifting consumer
behavior. Senior leaders must empower junior
colleagues to make decisions rapidly.

The next normal is still taking shape, and customer
expectations will continue to shift in response.
Retailers that focus on customer experience
and respond with agility and innovation in their
omnichannel experience will fare better and
strengthen their ties to customers.

Retailers have much ground to cover, and time is
of the essence. They should start by establishing a
North Star to guide their aspirations for customer
experience, with clear objectives across each of the
five actions described above. A cross-functional
team should take the lead in assessing the starting
point, quickly developing the path forward, and
driving implementation.

implications of automation and act quickly to respond to them.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

Retail is under pressure. Margins are stressed from
all sides: higher costs to manage e-commerce supply
chains, growing demands from suppliers to pass
on raw-material cost inflation, higher investments
to match new competition, and steadily rising labor
costs. At the same time, the customer’s expectations
continue to surge as digital natives and disruptors
alike raise the bar for personalized service—on
the back of what, at times, is an advantaged cost
structure. As retailers struggle to adapt, and even
to survive, they increasingly pursue automation
to address margin strain and more demanding
customer expectations. Automation, however, is
a new capability for all but digital natives, and the
sophistication in approach varies accordingly.
Over the past three years, the McKinsey Global
Institute has conducted a broad-based research
initiative on automation across sectors. This
research has shown that about half of the activities
in retail can be automated using current, at-scale
technology. While this number is alarming, the
change will be less about job loss and more about
the evolution of jobs, the creation of new ones,
and reskilling. Only about 5 percent of all jobs can
be fully automated with current technology, and
automation will lead to the creation of jobs as
companies invest in growth.

The thinking behind this report was done before the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic. We have considered whether the observations and
recommendations remain valid in this turbulent time and have concluded that
the direction outlined still fits with the ‘next normal’ we expect retailers to
navigate, and is now even more pertinent with the acceleration of shopping
trends. We have seen a fundamental step change in the shift towards online
shopping and home delivery during the COVID-19 lockdown period across
the world, which we expect will be sustained post COVID-19 and accelerate
channel shifts the midterm. Shoppers are trialing new ways to shop—for
example 40 percent tried grocery delivery. We expect a level of long-term
“stickiness” from these changes—with lessons from China suggesting
retailers should still be expecting 10 to 20 percent year-on-year growth
online in most categories as the market moves towards the ‘next normal.’
The situation has given businesses a stronger sense of what they need in
order to deliver, to be more productive, and to have the flexibility to operate
in downtimes or when demand surges beyond usual capacity. The expected
ongoing impact on the economy and consumer confidence puts further
pressure on retailers to find new ways to combat inflationary headwinds.
Customers have rising expectations around digital and automation, such as
touchless payments. If anything, COVID-19 is a reminder that retail may
need to reboot faster than anticipated.

Automation in retail: An executive overview for getting ready

New realities
In our work in the retail sector, we see automation
reshaping business models and the broader value
chain. Let’s start with four new realities we observe
among retailers.
1. Margin pressure has made automation a
requirement, not a choice
Retail-margin pressure is mounting, driven by more
intense competition, investment in e-commerce,
and pressure to increase wages. While these
cost pressures are not new, many retailers have
already exhausted traditional cost-reduction levers.
Unable to pass on costs to their customers in this
hypercompetitive environment, retailers are using
automation to support and bolster margins.
These pressures are consistent across retail
subsectors. Our analysis suggests that typical
grocery and hypermarket retailers face 100 to
150 basis points of margin pressure, and typical
specialty apparel or department stores 350 to
500 basis points. A comprehensive automation
program can significantly offset these headwinds.
Automation initiatives across store, supply-chain,
and headquarter functions can generate 300 to
500 basis points of incremental margin, which
retailers can reinvest in their growth opportunities.
2. The bottleneck to automation is internal,
not external
An assessment of available automation technologies
shows that they can already operate a typical retail
grocery store with up to 55 to 65 percent fewer
hours. The critical components include electronic
shelf-edge labels, self-checkout terminals, shelfscanning robots, and partially automated backroom
unloading. These technologies have been proved at
scale and offer internal rates of return higher than
historical retail hurdle rates—yet few retailers are
moving quickly to implementation.
In some cases, the bottleneck is a lack of skills and
capabilities. But one of the biggest challenges is
the inertia of the business. Retailers struggle to
break free from the soft tyranny of budget cycles
and the replication of last year’s capital spending.
Our corporate-finance research suggests that
two-thirds of companies fall into this trap. For these
players, more than 90 percent of a given year’s
capital expenditures simply reprise those of the
171

preceding year. Only one-third of companies are
dynamic reallocators, consistently shifting
30 to 40 percent to different business units or new
uses over five to six years—that is, a reallocation
rate of 5 to 6 percent a year. Dynamic reallocators
enjoy disproportionate rewards: growth in total
shareholder returns nearly three percentage points
higher than those of other companies over an
extended time period.
3. If you aren’t already implementing automation,
you are falling behind Amazon
Amazon, which has made headlines with its Amazon
Go retail concept, has been the most prominent
disruptor. Through the implementation of automation
technology, we believe that Amazon Go has the
potential to deliver top-line benefits due to additional
transacting traffic from reduced wait times and the
use of customer insights to optimize assortments
and personalize promotions. Further potential could
come from the opportunity of commercializing
customer data and insights. The company now
operates ten Amazon Go stores, in three US cities,
and the tech giant has ambitious expansion plans:
3,000 stores by 2021.
Amazon is not alone. Faced with disruption and the
opportunity to expand margins, select incumbent
retailers are also investing in automation and
artificial-intelligence (AI) technologies at scale
to enhance both the customer and employee
experience. Take, for example, Kroger Edge: digital
shelves (which the retailer rolled out across 200
stores in 2018) that display prices, nutrition facts,
coupons, and video advertisements—all dynamically
updatable from a central source. Eventually, Kroger
plans to link the shelves to shoppers’ smartphones,
allowing an increased level of personalization.
Ahold Delhaize and Albertsons have announced
partnerships with Takeoff Technologies, a company
that builds automated miniwarehouses for the
robotic in-store fulfillment of digital orders. Other
retailers are exploring technology use cases for
employee activities. Target and Walmart have
invested in autonomous cleaning robots that save
hours of its associates’ time. Walmart has also rolled
out virtual-reality headsets to train associates, as
well as the FAST Unloader technology to automate

172

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

the backrooms of stores. If recent headlines are any
indication, the adoption of these technologies by
retailers will accelerate.
4. The automation opportunity is bigger
than operations
Much of the discussion about the future of work in
retail has focused on the use cases for automation
and AI in stores. However, supply-chain and headquarter functions (such as merchandising) will also
be affected massively.
Consider merchandising. Today, automatable activities account for approximately 30 to 40 percent
of the time of merchants, who, for example, spend
about 20 percent of their time on merchandiseplanning activities. Advanced planning systems
can automate historical analytics and generate
predictive scenarios, significantly reducing the
time needed to plan merchandise and empowering
merchants to make faster decisions. Similarly,
dynamic systems with web-scraping and predictive
impact analytics could automate pricing and promotions. Automating these and other time-intensive
processes will enable merchants to increase the
time they spend on more strategic activities, creating
value for the enterprise (Exhibit 1).
Automation can also make HR processes more
efficient and provide leaders with new insights for
a successful people strategy. One retailer we know,
for example, designed an app-based hiring tool to
streamline the recruitment of store associates. At
the start of the project, the recruiting process was
difficult. Each candidate would provide almost 50
documents and visit the company’s offices up to five
times; end-to-end, the whole thing took an average
of 45 days. To make matters worse, about 40 percent
of the associates hired left within six months.
To solve these problems, the company established
an agile, cross-functional working team, which
created minimum viable products in just ten weeks:
for candidates, a mobile-app tool to help browse
jobs and apply for them; for HR managers, a webbased tool to screen and identify potential hires.
Now implemented in more than 1,000 stores, the
solution has not only reduced hiring time by more
than 80 percent and store administrative hours by

20 percent but also improved the quality of new
hires through the application of advanced analytics
to applications.
Supply chains offer several more automation
use cases, and retailers are at the forefront of
implementation. Target and Walmart have partnered
with Swisslog to build warehouses with automated
case picking. Ocado sells its Smart Platform, a
proprietary e-commerce warehousing solution, to
other retailers. More broadly, automated smart
robots can store, retrieve, depalletize, and transport
products—all while calculating optimal routes
through a warehouse. Drones and robots can also
be used for security and safety surveillance and for
quality checks.

Automation in retail: An executive overview for getting ready

Battlegrounds to survive and thrive
In this section, we explore the critical imperatives
for retailers as they build the workforce of the future
(see sidebar, “Is your management team actively
preparing for the future of work?”).
1. Organizational structures and ways of working
must be transformed
Adding technology, by itself, is not enough. Retailers
must also rethink their operating models across
stores, distribution centers, and headquarters.
Automation creates organizations with far fewer
layers—each employee is responsible for a more
diverse set of responsibilities. Real-time data and
analytics will empower faster decision making.

173

Is your management team actively preparing for the future of work?
Questions to consider:
—

—

What is the size and scope of the
workforce that would be affected by
your technology road map?
What business changes or adjacencies
could generate significant new jobs?

—

—

Do you have a plan to train people
for the skills of the future? Who will be
your partners?
Given the workforce implications
across the economy, would you
prefer to address them proactively or
reactively?

Consider a store that employs shelf-scanning robots,
effectively automating a large part of a traditional
store-department-manager’s role. The instructions
of a robot rather than a department manager guide
stockers, who now work more efficiently and can
therefore be cross-trained to perform additional
in-store activities, such as providing service to
customers or picking online orders. Meanwhile,
retailers must reconsider the organizational
structure, since they no longer provide a career
path from stocker to department manager to store
manager. Stockers must now move laterally through
multiple teams while building leadership skills
through outside training and executive exposure
before moving on to leadership roles in stores.
To fully unlock the benefits of this technological
transformation, extensive adopters of automation
and AI are exploring more agile ways of working.
Structurally, this means shifting from strict
hierarchies and siloed functions; instead, “teams of
teams” are built around end-to-end accountability,
with flexible resources that improve work flow.
These teams are empowered with real-time data,
and decisions are purposefully decentralized to
cultivate a bias to action.

Do you have a plan to source new
talent at all levels of the company?

—

How do wages need to evolve so
that you retain workers and attract
good talent?

2. The redeployment of labor is a strategic
opportunity missed by most
Efficiency is often perceived as the primary
motivator for adopting automation technologies, but
among retailers, innovation is the ultimate way to
survive. As they implement automation technology,
they create a large bank of hours with a trained and
trusted workforce. The opportunity to redeploy a
portion of these hours to more valuable activities
provides an opening for a differentiating kind
of innovation.
Several grocers, for example, are creating new roles
for in-store pickers and e-commerce distribution
centers. One example of near-in redeployment is
Ahold Delhaize’s e-commerce investments, which
will add 150 new jobs to the local economy in
Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, McDonald’s
has not only introduced table service in restaurants
but also rolled out self-service ordering kiosks.
Best Buy has pushed further into adjacent services,
creating new customer-service roles in its In-Home
Advisor and Total Tech Support programs and
retraining employees for them. In the years to come,
we will see additional retailers explore shifting labor
into other, further-out uses, such as home health
care or installation services.

3. Retailers must prepare for skilling and
reskilling at scale
As the demand for physical and manual skills
declines, the need for technological skills, as well as
social and emotional ones, will rise quickly in every
sector, including retail (Exhibit 2). Faced with the
skill gap created by the future of work, retailers have
three options to acquire talent: hire new employees,
outsource to gig workers and external partners, or
reskill current workers.
While hiring may appear to be an ideal solution, the
rapid growth of technology companies and the
digitization of incumbents have diminished the available skill pool. Companies report that an inability to
source talent is the main reason for delaying digital

is hardly
surprising;
Automation in retail:

of workwe
estimate that digital skills are available in only half
Exhibit 3 of 4
the needed quantity and agile skills in only a quarter.
Retailers therefore cannot assume that hiring and

outsourcing will bridge the skill gap, and this leaves a
mandate to reskill employees.
Although reskilling takes a good deal of effort, it
often offers a higher return on investment, in the
longer term, than hiring; in fact, the business case
for reskilling can be 1.5 to three times better. On
average, replacing an employee can cost 20 to
30 percent of an annual salary, reskilling less than
10 percent. Reskilling existing employees also
allows a retailer to retain institutional knowledge
and saves the ramp-up time needed to onboard
new hires. Furthermore, reskilling is more likely
to earn goodwill from employees, customers,
and governments alike. This goodwill can have
tangible benefits; approximately 40 percent
of transformations fail because of employee
resistance, so a reskilling campaign can mitigate
that risk. For these reasons, we believe that
reskilling will be a large part of the answer for

retailers. Across industries, global executives agree:
75 percent of those surveyed say reskilling will
provide at least half of the solution for the skill gap.

talent strategy more broadly—looking, for example,
at the implications for site decisions and the role of
outsourcing to external partners and gig workers.

Employers will play a leading role in helping workers
to reskill, but collaboration with external partners
will also be required. For instance, educational
institutions and industry associations can create
specialized curriculums and certifications for future
skills. Not-for-profit organizations can develop
innovative approaches to make reskilling efforts
more affordable and effective. Such partnerships
are even more important for smaller retailers (such
as regional grocery chains) that may have fewer
resources for a substantive reskilling effort.

Employers increasingly view talent—not realestate costs—as the primary driver of decisions
regarding office locations, and many are moving
their headquarters to optimize for talent. Ahold
Delhaize’s Peapod and McDonald’s have both moved
their headquarters from the outskirts of Chicago to
the heart of downtown. The Canadian grocery chain
Loblaws runs its Loblaws Digital organization in a
trendy Toronto neighborhood rather than the main
headquarters, in the suburbs. Executives from each
of these companies have cited the need to attract
talent as the key motivation for their site decisions.

Companies at the forefront of employee-reskilling
efforts recognize the importance of collaboration.
Walmart’s Dollar a Day college-tuition program,
for example, has won support from other key
organizations since it started. To ensure the
initiative’s success, Walmart has partnered with
Guild Education, which provides coaches to help
the company’s employees select the appropriate
degree and navigate the college-application
process. Walmart also picked its university partners
thoughtfully, choosing three—Bellevue University,
Brandman University, and the University of Florida—
known for their high graduation rates and focus on
adult learners. AT&T launched Future Ready, a $1
billion web-based, multiyear reskilling effort, with the
support of universities (such as Georgia Tech) and
online platforms (for instance, Coursera and Udacity).
4. Talent-acquisition strategies require
an upgrade
As previously mentioned, the future of work is
heightening the competition for skilled employees.
Given the relative scarcity, retailers must approach

176

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

By engaging gig workers and outsourcing tasks
to partners (rather than hiring), retailers can also
expand the way they define the acquisition of
talent. Today, roughly one-third of US workers are
freelancers; if current trends continue, independent
workers could become the majority of the US
workforce by 2027. Tapping into this gig economy
helps employers to fill specific skill gaps quickly
and more flexibly, and the opportunity to pay for
outcomes can help minimize costs. Understanding
these benefits, several leading companies across
the full consumer ecosystem—both manufacturers
and retailers—are exploring the potential of
independent workers. Coca-Cola, for instance,
invested early in the gig-economy platform
Wonolo, which connects gig workers with potential
employers. It remains a customer of the platform
today, along with the North Face and Uniqlo. P&G
piloted an on-demand talent initiative for projectbased work, such as translations and content
creation. The result was faster resourcing, improved
quality, and lower costs.

5. Wage reinvestments are a missed
opportunity—few invest strategically
As retailers introduce additional automation into
their retail models, they will end up with fewer but
more highly skilled jobs. To get the right talent,
retailers must invest in higher wages and benefits.
Many retailers are managing this shift reactively,
investing only when they find that they can’t attract
and retain the right talent profiles. That’s a missed
opportunity to take a more strategic investment
approach, which can yield a higher ROI. To prepare
for wage reinvestment, retailers should now develop
the ability to differentiate performance and rewards
for key contributors. This is also the moment to
develop a clear skill-and-certification ladder that
can reward employees with higher pay.
6. Every retailer needs a social-impact plan
Automation will disproportionately disrupt retail,
since three out of the five most automated jobs
in any sector in the United States are in retail
(Exhibit 3). By the numbers, automation will have
a disproportionate impact on the entry-level roles

with the lowest levels of skill—and the highest
turnover. As a result, retail’s role in where “America
learns to work” may shift.
The remaining retail jobs will probably be better
paid, with higher skills and lower turnover. As even
frontline retail jobs become more advanced, society
will face a broader question: how to create better
pathways so that people with entry-level skills can
acquire new ones and thrive. Retailers can take a
lead in answering this question—and in tailoring the
solutions by types of people and communities.

The future of work has arrived in retail. Executives
should prepare for the impact of automation and
AI technologies across all core functions and
proactively address the workforce implications. The
longer companies wait to respond, the higher the
risk they will not be able to catch up. Addressing
automation and workforce transitions should be at
the top of every retail management team’s agenda.

setup of their IT departments.

This article first
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
February 2020.

“The IT is the problem—as usual!” This complaint
is a constant refrain whenever retailers with brickand-mortar origins realize that desired process
improvements or technology-reliant product
innovations will be delayed, must take a different
form than planned, or won’t happen at all. Usually
this statement is true and false in equal measure. It’s
true because today nearly every change a retailer
might make depends on technological solutions,
which often fall below expectations. But it’s false as
well because, often, the root cause of the problem
is the business side, not IT. In fact, a joint study
by Oxford University and McKinsey of more than
5,000 IT projects identified three reasons behind
most failures: inadequate management of the many
people involved, investment that is not aligned
to business needs, and a lack of transparency
regarding the project portfolio. As retailers across
the globe are dealing with implications of COVID-19,
and preparing for the ‘Next Normal’, technologyenablement of the retail value chain has become
more critical than ever. Traditional business-IT
operating models will not deliver the results.

The biggest stumbling block:
Silo structures
Invisible trenches between the IT department
and the rest of the company constitute one of
the main reasons why brick-and-mortar retailers
often struggle far more with technology than
their digitally native counterparts. Many decision
makers in traditional companies still see IT as an
administrative function positioned somewhere
below the CFO, far away from the operative business
owners. Typically, in such IT departments, big teams
toil away on large monolithic projects, and resources
are allocated based on political criteria rather than
business factors. Business-side practitioners and
developers seldom share ideas directly with each
other. As a result, this type of IT function is generally
unattractive to digital talent, and commercially
successful retailers struggle to build the internal
technology competence that they need.
The technological shortcomings that result from
this siloed structure can threaten a retailer’s very
existence—especially as the demands it faces

invest and innovate aggressively. Over the past few
years, leading retailers such as Kroger, John Lewis,
Tesco, and Walmart have significantly boosted their
technology investments. However, many retailers
still devote less than 1.5 percent of revenue to
developing their technology assets.
While more investment is essential, an incumbent
retailer cannot close the gap to the industry’s
technology leaders by simply throwing more money
at the problem. Choosing the right digital model and
continuously developing it using a test-and-learn
process are far more important. The company must
build a modern technology organization to support
the delivery of the best business results. In the end,
transforming mind-sets, capabilities, and ways of
working is critical not only in classical IT areas such
as application development and infrastructure
but also in core commercial divisions like sales,
merchandising, and marketing.

Paths to a modern
technology organization
When it comes to organizing IT, traditional retailers
might look to digital pioneers such as Amazon or
Zalando. Although some digital natives have their
own struggles when it comes to their IT setup—for
example, the scalability of their technology—they
are nevertheless good role models based on one
organizational commitment in particular: for them,
joint responsibility for commercial processes and
technology development has always been the rule.
Retailers can consider this basic idea and optimize
their technological performance in six steps:
1. Entrust responsibility to small, crossfunctional product teams
The modern technology organization is no longer
a large IT department organized according to
IT systems. Instead, small teams of developers
provide technical support for specific business
processes, known as products. For example,
individual teams could be built around
assortment planning (in sales or purchasing),

179

pricing and promotions (marketing), or inventory
management (supply chain). The products are
defined at a granular-enough level that a small
team of developers can support the process
from beginning to end. This approach enables
“tearing down the walls” between business
and IT. The granular structure also creates an
opportunity to connect each of the products
and development teams with a counterpart from
the business side—a connection that typically
increases the teams’ effectiveness. Because
of their cross-functional staff, such teams can

drive further development independently and

be measured against the concrete business

results of their work. One retailer, which has
been moving toward such a structure with
approximately 90 product teams, shows just

how differentiated the new structure can be
(Exhibit 1).
2. Set up ‘tech chapters’ as new structures
within IT
The establishment of product teams usually
requires a change of the classical IT structures
with leaders at the division, department, and
team level. One option that is currently used
by many companies is to replace the classical
structure with “tech chapters” that manage the
professional development of employees in the
product teams and recruit new tech specialists.
Typically, chapter leaders do not influence the
content of product development (the “what”),
focusing instead on the methodology and
technology (the “how”). In large IT organizations

(1,000 employees or more), retailers typically
break up the tech chapters, as otherwise
the resulting organizational units would
become too big and the responsibilities would
become unclear. One option is to break the
tech chapters into domains. For example, the
“customer” domain would be in charge of all
customer-facing products. This can be an
effective way to create groups of employees
who would benefit the most from sharing
knowledge with each other.
3. Assign product ownership to the business
Instead of the business side throwing
requirements “over the wall” to the IT department,
in this new model each product team has a
product owner from one of the business divisions.
He or she leads the content of the team’s work
and, in contrast to most of today’s models, is not
limited to defining requirements. They determine
what their teams work on and initiate the
development of further technological solutions
that can improve the company’s performance in
their respective business area. This means that
the head of sales, for example, is responsible
for the checkout product team; the head of
purchasing has responsibility for the demandplanning product team. Product owners work
with their product teams using agile methods;
product teams and tech chapters work together
as needed. Product owners directly drive
development with a business mind- set, while
the chapter leaders contribute technological
know-how (Exhibit 2). In many cases, this model
will require a retailer to hire experienced productowner profiles into the business—individuals who
are not only deeply knowledgeable about the
business but are also tech-savvy, with nuanced
insights about how to get the most out of the
business/technology interface.
4. Specify KPIs as standards of success for
each team
Binding key performance indicators (KPIs) let
product owners and their teams know how their
performance is measured and where it needs to
improve. Digital retailers have long used team-

The end of IT in retail?

specific KPIs where instead of a single target for
everyone based on an indicator, like overall sales
development, each team has its own set of KPIs
linked to business performance. This ensures
that developers have incentive in the same
way as their colleagues in the corresponding
business area. For the marketing team, for
example, a KPI could be transaction cost per
website visitor; for the search team, the share
of search results that lead to a purchase; and
for the recommendation team, sales generated
through recommendations. By setting targets
for indicators like these, retailers ensure that the
team’s objectives are in line with those of the
company as a whole. The KPIs themselves may
not be new, but using them to explicitly evaluate
the content of technology development inspires
a much stronger commitment to them—they
essentially become the currency that product
teams use to both prioritize their activities and
demonstrate their usefulness.
5. Add sponsors at the top-management level
Ideally, each business division will have a sponsor
on the executive board whose involvement
includes setting priorities for his or her area. This
close connection to top management helps
resolve cross-divisional conflicts regarding
development priorities early on and reduce the
need for coordination at the expert level. Another
welcome side effect: technological questions
and their prioritization become consequential not
only for product owners but also for nearly every
manager in the company.
6. Modernize the tech stack
To realize the maximum benefit from such
a transformation, it is crucial to enable the
product teams by reviewing and updating
the tech stack. Typically, the result is a rather
intensive modernization with a higher degree
of modularization. To ensure scalability and
allow for rapid change, a shift to cloud platforms
and SaaS solutions is inevitable. Further,
most companies are working on breaking up
their monolithic architecture and moving to
microservices with a clear API-first strategy.

This will simultaneously decrease the need for
manual operations and pave the way to migrate
to a DevOps setup, where most product teams
are responsible not only for developing their
products but also for running them. Retailers on
this journey typically take a stepwise approach—
starting from where they expect to capture
the highest business value. In general, we see
two approaches that companies have used to
implement a modern technology organization:
— “Big bang.” Changing the full setup all at once
has the advantage of a short implementation
timeline. However, it also requires a tremendous
amount of preparation and bears a high risk of
disrupting daily operations.

and provides enough time for affected
employees from the business functions to
understand and adapt to the required changes.
In most cases, the step-by-step approach will
be the preferred choice.

New organization, new challenges
Tearing down the walls between business and
IT by implementing the transformation steps
described here can unleash vast potential.
Experience shows that the resulting setup enables
companies to develop and use new technologies
much more efficiently (see sidebar, “Suddenly
fast and reliable: How two retailers benefit from
restructuring their IT setup”). At the same time, it
frees the classical IT function to focus exclusively
on cross-cutting technology topics. Central expert
teams work alongside the tech-chapter leaders
to make decisions on system architecture, ensure

Suddenly fast and reliable: How two retailers benefit from restructuring their IT setup
The experiences of two European
retailers show the value that reorganizing
technology structures can unlock:
— After making the organizational
changes, a housewares retailer was
able to complete an order-management
module, which had fallen months
behind schedule, within budget and in
less than two months.
— A food retailer using the new structure
managed to develop an entire technical

solution for food deliveries—from
the online shop to the management
of merchandise, inventories, and the
delivery fleet—within ten months. The
solution went live on schedule.
In both cases, the key to success was
entrusting operational decision makers
from the business side to take on the role
of a product owner. It quickly became
clear that they could be far more targeted
in identifying and prioritizing requirements
when their responsibility expanded from

data security, and manage relationships with
major technology partners. Responsibility for
infrastructure, such as cloud computing and data
pipes, is another overarching concern that is an
important enabler function.
Demands on the chief technology officer (CTO) as
the organization’s ultimate technology authority
increase as well. The new model requires the CTO
to have greater business foresight, since he or
she must provide the right impetus for potential
digitization initiatives in the organization. Therefore,
the CTO should not only possess outstanding
capabilities but also be positioned at eye level with
the other business-unit leaders and top managers.
That’s why retailers that move toward this structure
often decide to make the CTO a board-level role.
The changes laid out here are immense: decades-

simply operating solutions to shaping
them as well. At the same time, having
product owners working with product
teams put the responsibility of deciding
on potential benefits and costs in one
place—an important prerequisite for
making technology decisions from a
business perspective.

old structures disappear, hundreds of employees
must learn new ways of working, and in many cases,
the business becomes directly responsible for
technology development.
Implementing a modern technology organization
takes time. Companies may be able to set up
business-led product teams in a matter of
months, but fully learning the corresponding new
behaviors and ways of working can take years. The
transformation will be successful only if the topmanagement team wholeheartedly stands behind
the journey.
Transforming from a classical IT department to a
modern technology organization is a radical step,
but taking it can mean the difference between a
retailer struggling to survive and one that translates
digitization into genuine business success.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

The COVID-19 pandemic is both an unprecedented
health crisis and a global economic shock. The
effect on the fashion industry has been severe:
according to current estimates, year-on-year
industry revenues will contract by 27 to 30 percent
in 2020, although the industry could regain positive
growth of 2 to 4 percent by the end of 2021. We
expect a large number of global fashion companies
to go bankrupt in the next 12 to 18 months. Some
of this is a function of the challenging position
that many fashion players were already in before
the pandemic: profitability in the sector has
deteriorated consistently over the past eight years.
Only 44 percent of global fashion companies
generated economic profit in 2018.

This article originally
appeared on
McKinsey.com in
May 2020.

Although no one in the industry foresaw the intensity
of this crisis, some fashion companies are finding
that they are better equipped than others—largely
because of their digital know-how. In this article, we
touch on COVID-19’s impact on the fashion industry
to date. We then propose a set of actions that fashion
companies can take to build their digital and analytics
capabilities—not just to ensure business continuity
and minimize the downside of COVID-19, but also to
emerge from the crisis in a position of strength.

A deepening digital divide
Our consumer-sentiment surveys, conducted
in mid-May, show 40 to 50 percent declines in
purchase intent for fashion categories among
European consumers.1 E-commerce is clearly not
offsetting the sales declines in stores. Nevertheless,
it has been a lifeline for fashion brands as many
stores have been (or remain) shuttered—and it
will continue to be critical during and after the
recovery period. In China, the return of offline traffic
and revenue has been gradual: in early May, two
months after stores reopened, revenue was down
40 percent in fashion outlets and 30 percent in
department stores from pre-COVID-19 levels, while
online sales continued to grow. This suggests that
some percentage of offline sales could permanently
migrate to e-commerce.

A number of trends in the post-COVID-19 world—the
“next normal”—will make digital and analytics play
an even more important role.2 Physical distancing
appears likely to continue, making consumers less
likely to visit brick-and-mortar stores, and a contactfree economy is already starting to emerge—raising
e-commerce and automation to a new level.
The implications of these trends will differ for each
company, depending on its digital starting point
and strategic orientation. Digital and analytics
leaders (companies in which online sales account
for 30 to 40 percent of total sales, parts of the
value chain are significantly digitized, and online
and offline channels are integrated to some degree)
have an advantage today but could quickly lose
it if other players accelerate their transformation.
On the other hand, laggards (companies with less
than 20 percent of total sales coming from the
online channel, low digitization levels across the
value chain, and siloed online and offline operating
models) have an opportunity to make an “all in” bet
on digital and analytics—and perhaps gain market
share with smaller capital-expenditure investments,
which used to be a limiting factor for many brands.
Digital is not only an increasingly important
sales channel; it can also help companies adapt
cost structures and make each step of the value
chain better, faster, and cheaper. For example,
digitization can enable new logistics and salesfulfillment options (such as click-and-collect and
drive-through), fuel innovative ways of customer
acquisition, and help predict and manage inventory
to create a more resilient supply chain. The
fundamental enabler to all this will be data—the
transparency, governance, and accuracy of which
have never been more important.
This all portends a deepening digital divide. Even
before the crisis, companies that were digitally
and analytically mature outperformed competitors
that hadn’t invested in robust digital and analytics
capabilities (Exhibit 1). The COVID-19 crisis has only
widened the gap between industry leaders and

laggards. For leaders with the ability and willingness
to invest, the pandemic has clearly been an
accelerator in the shift to digital. As a top executive
of a leading apparel player recently declared, “We’ve
accomplished two years of digital transformation in
two months.”

For executives in the fashion sector and all related
subsectors (such as beauty and sporting goods), the
imperative is clear: make digital and analytics a core
element of your company’s strategy.

That said, digitization won’t be a panacea.
Companies should direct investments to areas
in which the highest business value lies—which
might not be in sales but rather elsewhere in the
value chain. Equally important, companies should
avoid “gold plating,” aiming instead for the fastest
minimum viable digital solution that will achieve the
business goal. Finally, the sequencing of initiatives
will play a big role in making a company’s digital
transformation as self-funding as possible. The
fundamental enabler to all this will be data—the
transparency, governance, and accuracy of which
have never been more important.

The health and safety of employees and customers,
of course, has been—and remains—the absolute
priority. As fashion companies start to reopen their
networks, health and safety precautions have led to
a reimagining of operations, from how employees
collaborate to how associates interact with
consumers in stores. Digitization and automation
are at the heart of these transformations.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

Navigate the now: Short-term priorities

Although the situation remains uncertain and is
evolving daily, there are clear actions involving
digital and analytics that fashion players should
implement now.

Engage with your customers in an authentic way
Email, social media, and other digital channels have
seen significant spikes in usage during the crisis
(Exhibit 2). Fashion brands must therefore continue
to communicate frequently with consumers. Use
digital channels to launch genuine, purpose-driven
communications regarding health, safety, business
continuity, and community building. If you decide to
send consumers relevant content, be sure to do so
in an appropriate and empathetic tone (for example,

when many consumers are switching their primary
brands and retailers (75 percent of consumers say
that trust in a brand has become a relevant factor
in their purchasing decisions) and finding their
routines disrupted.
Refine and scale up your online operation
We expect the online share of fashion and apparel
in Europe and North America to increase by 20 to
40 percent during the next 6 to 12 months. In
April, traffic to the top 100 fashion brands’ owned
websites rose by 45 percent in Europe.3 Some of the

in developing advanced analytical tools to steer
markdowns during the crisis will pay off almost
immediately.
Optimize costs using a zero-based approach
In light of crisis-related sales decreases, cutting
costs is an obvious imperative for most companies.
However, reducing all budget lines across the board
is risky. We recommend a zero-based budgeting
approach instead.
Identify two categories of projects: critical projects
linked to core digital and analytics priorities that
must proceed as planned or at a slightly lower
speed (for example, building a new data lake to
enable personalized marketing) and core projects
that can be delayed (such as those that don’t
enable emergency response). Continue only the
projects that fall into those two categories; stop
all others. A range of savings levers—such as
vendor renegotiations and tactical moves to the
cloud—can help dramatically reduce your operating
costs. Reset your digital and analytics priorities and
budget and adapt them to a post-coronavirus world.

— A focus on getting to a minimum viable product
(MVP) within two to three months—a rapid
timeline that allows the company to iterate
while generating value, avoiding large up-front
investments.

— A central team to monitor value capture. This
team also helps build the road map by scanning
opportunities, allocating budgets, and
coordinating implementation, ensuring that all
efforts are focused on delivering tangible impact
rather than gold plating.

Well-defined key performance indicators (KPIs)
to measure success.

The first step in the transformation program should
be the definition of digital priorities, which will
differ based on each company’s business model
and digital starting point. Digitization is much more
than just selling online; a quick diagnostic may be
required to select and align on key value areas.
Typically, digital and analytics priorities can be
categorized according to their place in the value
chain: customer experience (front), distribution and
supply chain (middle), and product development
and support functions (back). Exhibit 6 shows highimpact use cases in each of these three areas.

The pandemic has elevated digital channels as a

must-have for fashion players. Therefore, take this

opportunity to leapfrog into the digital arena by
making it the center of your operating model: move
your traffic- and engagement-generation engine to
digital, and leverage digital channels to drive store
traffic and vice versa.
Besides scaling up digital sales efforts, reconfigure
your store footprint accordingly—for example, by
reducing presence in “B” areas (markets with
lower population density and lower profitability
per square meter), devoting less store space to
product categories with high online penetration,
experimenting with innovative formats (such as drivethrough windows or pop-up stores), and making
it easy for customers to perform any omnichannel
operation, including complex ones (such as buying
online from a store if the product isn’t in stock there,
and then picking it up from another physical store
in the next 12 hours). Use data and analytics to tailor
the assortment in each store and to streamline and
optimize assortments overall.
In our experience, fully integrated management
of stock in stores and warehouses is core to any
omnichannel operation. Making all stock (even stock
shortly arriving to warehouses) visible to customers
in any channel has proved to boost sales.

Digital and analytics can not only drive
top-line growth but also significantly
improve speed, cost, flexibility, and
sustainability across the supply chain.
Bet on personalization
Personalization has helped several industry players
achieve 20 to 30 percent increases in customer
lifetime value across high-priority customer
segments. It has proved even more valuable in
subsectors with more stable and predictable
purchasing patterns, such as beauty products.
Use cases for personalization have mostly centered
on personalized offers, personalized promotions
and benefits (such as access to new products), and
reductions in generic traffic-generation costs. To
go further, add personalization capabilities to your
digital war room—for example, by collecting and
analyzing all the available data to generate detailed
insights about your customers. Build actionable
microclusters based on customer behavior. For
instance, entice the highest spenders with
special incentives (such as triple loyalty points for
purchases of at least $1,000), target customers who
tend to buy in the categories where you have the
largest inventory buildup, and give online customers
coupons to redeem in-store once physical stores
reopen.
Prioritize use cases based on your business context,
advanced-analytics capabilities, and customer
segments. Create a prioritized use-case road
map and a technology-investment plan. Integrate
personalization into all delivery channels to ensure
consistency in your customer communications.
Leverage big data and analytics to manage the
supply chain
Digital and analytics can not only drive top-line
growth but also significantly improve speed, cost,
flexibility, and sustainability across the supply
chain. For instance, some leading companies
are using radio-frequency identification (RFID)

192

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

to track products more precisely and reduce
in-store merchandising manipulation. Companies’
RFID investments typically yield operations
simplifications and service-level improvements.
In addition, automating logistics through digital
warehouse design and predictive exception
management can significantly increase efficiency.
The benefits will flow to consumers as well—in
the form of better product availability and faster,
cheaper, and more accurate deliveries. Leading
online players, for example, are using models
powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to predict
sales of specific products in certain neighborhoods
and cities, then stocking the predicted amount of
inventory in nearby warehouses.
Digitize product development and support
functions
During the COVID-19 crisis, the digitization
of product development has proved to be a
competitive advantage. Companies that were
already using cutting-edge tools such as 3-D
product design, virtual sampling, digital material
libraries, and AI-supported planning have fared
better than their peers during the crisis. Their
designers and merchandisers could react faster to
market trends, significantly reduce both sample
costs and time-to-market, and collaborate remotely
across teams. The past several weeks have shown
that it’s possible to do much more on this front
than some in the industry initially thought. Indeed,
the pandemic may have shattered historical
preconceptions and biases against digitization in
core product-development processes.
Digitization of support functions is another key
lever for improving efficiency. By automating
repetitive tasks in back-office functions such as

indirect purchasing, finance, legal, and HR, you
can simultaneously reduce costs and free up
time and resources to reinvest in more valuable
activities. Companies that have automated their
finance processes—such as claims collection and
financial reconciliation—have found that they’ve
also increased the agility and accuracy of these
processes while capturing significant synergies.
Speed up the digitization of all support functions
through robotic process automation and other
leading-edge technologies.
Build data and tech enablers to support your
transformation
Technical enablers play a key role in powering digital
and analytics growth. In our experience, three core
principles are the most relevant:
—

Use cloud infrastructures to sustain scaling and
to access best-in-class services, particularly
for use cases that best benefit from the cloud’s
features (for instance, data consumption across
the globe, very high storage and processing
needs).

— Think data from the start. Build solid data
foundations as part of every digital and analytics
initiative in a way that allows rapid scaling and
forward compatibility. Design and build out
pragmatic data governance focused on enabling
business value by helping to ensure data
breadth, depth, and quality. Establish a strong
data culture and ethics.
—

Design your technology stack for faster
integration and development, with applications
broken down into microservices and isolated
through the use of application programming
interfaces; use unified DevOps toolchains to
enable automation and reduce time-to-market
to a matter of hours instead of weeks.

These enablers shouldn’t become causes for delay.
Rather, they should follow the same agile timelines
and sprints as the core initiatives. Implementation
should be pragmatic and clearly linked to value
generation.
Attract and retain top digital talent
After the crisis, financially stable companies may
be able to attract top-notch digital talent, including
in-demand profiles such as digital-marketing
specialists, data scientists, data engineers, userexperience and user-interface designers, and
software and data architects. Retaining these
kinds of employees will require fashion companies
to develop new talent processes—with tailored
initiatives in recruiting, career growth, learning and
development, and performance management—
specifically for engineering and digital talent,
similar to what many fashion players already do for
designers and creative directors.
In addition, fashion players should adopt agile
ways of working to speed up development of
digital and analytics products and projects. Agile
techniques enable companies to release MVPs into
the marketplace quickly and refine them iteratively
based on consumer feedback.

There’s no denying that the COVID-19 pandemic
will make for a difficult 2020. For some fashion
companies, even survival may be a struggle. However,
if they lead with empathy and undertake bold
actions in digital and analytics—particularly around
e-commerce, data-driven stock management, and
digitization of key functions—we believe they can
not only endure the crisis but also build competitive
advantage and strengthen their business for an
omnichannel, digital-centered next normal.

After weeks of quarantine and physical distancing,
what does the future hold for US restaurants—and
for the more than eight million restaurant workers
across the country who have been laid off or
furloughed since March? How quickly will US
consumers feel comfortable eating out again?

—

Reliance on day-part occasions. With many
people working from home, restaurants that
generated much of their business from daytime
eating occasions—such as people getting
breakfast or coffee on the way to work—have
been disproportionately affected.

COVID-19 has not only been a devastating publichealth crisis; it has also been the restaurant
industry’s greatest challenge to date. Never
before have so many restaurants been forced to
cease operations; some will never reopen. Early
indications—from China and other countries
where the pandemic seemed to be under control—
suggest that consumer demand won’t immediately
rebound when restrictions are lifted. However,
restaurants that plan ahead to adapt and refine
their restaurant model for the “next normal”1
will be better positioned to bring sales back to
precrisis levels.

The pandemic’s impact to date
COVID-19’s economic toll on the restaurant industry
hasn’t been evenly distributed. Whereas pizza
chains have maintained or increased sales during
the pandemic, casual-dining and fine-dining
restaurants have seen their revenues decline by as
much as 85 percent (Exhibit 1). For some fine-dining
establishments, revenues fell to zero.
Each restaurant’s performance during the crisis has
depended largely on the following factors:
— Off-premise versus on-premise sales mix.
Unsurprisingly, restaurants with high offpremise sales prior to the crisis are faring better
than those that relied more on dine-in sales.

Digital maturity. A strong online-ordering
presence, digital loyalty programs, and robust
customer-relationship-management (CRM)
systems have been lifelines for restaurants
during this crisis, as levels of digital engagement
among consumers have soared. If trends in
China are any indication, consumers could
remain more digitally engaged even after the
crisis. Starbucks China, for instance, saw a
12-percentage-point increase in the share of
digital transactions postcrisis—from 15 percent
in January to 27 percent in late March (down
from a peak of 80 percent in February).
Role of value. Consumer perception of value
and the prevalence of deals have buoyed
some restaurants’ sales during the crisis,
as customers—suffering financial losses

and fearing continuing financial insecurity—
increasingly look for ways to save money.
Just as the impact of the crisis isn’t uniform across
restaurants and regions, the pace and shape of
recovery will also vary, not least because states
have different approaches and timelines for allowing
restaurants to reopen.

Scenarios for the industry’s recovery
Although much remains uncertain about the
pandemic’s effects, hopes of a quick economic
recovery are fading. Our colleagues have developed
nine scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 on
GDP, based on the extent of virus spread and the
effectiveness of public-health and economic-policy
responses (Exhibit 3).2

Just as the impact of the crisis isn’t
uniform across restaurants and regions,
the pace and shape of recovery will
also vary.

As of this writing, the likeliest scenarios appear to
be A1 and A3. While both assume partial to high
effectiveness of economic-policy interventions,
scenario A1 assumes resurgence of the virus across
regions whereas A3—the more optimistic of the
two—assumes rapid and effective control of virus
spread. In a late-April poll asking more than 2,000
global executives which scenario they see as most
likely, A1 was the most popular response, chosen by
nearly one-third of respondents; A3 came in second,
with 16 percent of the vote.
We modeled how quickly US restaurants might
recover under these two scenarios (Exhibit 4). In

How restaurants can thrive in the next normal

scenario A3, restaurant sales return to precrisis
levels in early 2021. In scenario A1, full recovery to
pre-COVID-19 sales takes three years longer. The
trajectories also differ by restaurant type, with
pizza chains and quick-service restaurants (QSRs)
recovering the fastest.
These are grim projections. Many restaurants
don’t have the financial means to endure such a
prolonged downturn. Especially vulnerable are
small franchisees (those with ten or fewer locations)
and independent operators not affiliated with a
chain. To survive, franchisees will need to receive

financial assistance from franchisors and from
the government, or drastically reduce their costs;
independents could have an even harder time
staying afloat because they don’t have access to the
loans and rent deferrals that franchisors can offer.
We estimate that, of the 650,000-plus US
restaurant locations that were in business in 2019,
approximately one in five—or more than 130,000—
will be permanently shuttered by next year.
Independents will bear the brunt of the closures,
both because of attributes that make most
independents more vulnerable in this pandemic
(minimal off-premise presence, limited digital
capabilities, low emphasis on value-based
menu items) and because of their unfavorable

198

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

economics (thin margins and poor access to
capital). Independents’ share of US restaurant
locations could fall from 53 percent in 2019 to
43 percent in 2021.
That said, the situation across the country remains
fluid. As states begin to lift restrictions and
restaurants gradually reopen, the scenarios could
change, depending largely on how well restaurants
implement the necessary safety measures to
prevent virus resurgence.

What to do next
Regardless of which scenario plays out, there’s no
denying that the coming months will be difficult

for most of the restaurant industry. For restaurant
operators across the country, we recommend
considering actions in two categories: those that
can help you return to stability and those that
can power you through to the next normal. With
foresight and careful planning, you can equip your
company to capture outsize value in the postCOVID-19 future.
Return to stability
In the recovery period, your top priorities ought to
include updating operating procedures, reactivating
customers to bring them back into restaurant
dining rooms, adjusting menus to address shifts in
customer habits and preferences, and enhancing
your delivery capabilities.

information: when your restaurants will be open
and why they can be confident that it’s safe to
come in.
— Customers who spent their money elsewhere.
Some fraction of customers may have shifted
their spending entirely to your competitors
during the pandemic—or made all their meals
at home. Effective marketing levers for this
segment could include loyalty-driven price
promotions and just-in-time offers featuring the
most popular items and personalized favorites.
—

Update operating procedures
As parts of the country ease restrictions on
businesses, proactively create a reopening
playbook. The playbook should include updated
standard operating procedures that not only provide
a safe store environment but also serve to reassure
potentially anxious customers. In other words,
simultaneously “go safe” and “show safe.” Ensure
that new hygiene and safety protocols are highly
—
visible throughout the restaurant.
In addition, adjust processes to improve labor
efficiency and to align with shifts in customer
behavior. An important part of restarting dine-in
service will be bringing back furloughed staff in
a way that matches the restaurant’s new needs
with employees’ skills. You will likely need to be
innovative to do this successfully—for example, by
using talent-exchange programs or partnering with
other companies to share labor.
Reactivate customers using a segmented
approach
Over the past several weeks, customers have
become accustomed to cooking at home more and
ordering online—behaviors that will likely have some
“stickiness” postpandemic. To entice customers
back to on-premise dining, tailor your approach to
each customer segment:
—

Loyal guests. Encourage loyal customers
to return to on-premise dining by sending
them personalized messages with critical

How restaurants can thrive in the next normal

People who became first-time customers
during the crisis. To retain these customers,
look to initiate them into your loyalty program
with a special offer. Also, make sure your digital
presence is consistent across platforms: for
example, the menu featured on your own app
should match the menu on any food-delivery
aggregators that these customers may have
used during the shelter-in-place period, and
should highlight the same family meals they
ordered during that time.
Potential customers. In a new dining landscape,
some customers who previously patronized
other restaurants will be “up for grabs.” It’s
an ideal time to re-evaluate your spending
mix with a marketing-return-on-investment
(MROI) simulator, which helps determine how
to invest marketing dollars across email, social
media, search, apps, local mass media, and
other channels.

Align the menu to new consumer preferences
During the recovery, consumer preferences will
have shifted toward value and off-premise dining—
but consumers will also be longing to return to
some semblance of normalcy even as they remain
concerned about health and safety. These new
consumer behaviors and preferences will require
restaurants to make menu and pricing adjustments.
Start by reintroducing your full precrisis menu items
such as breakfast, alcohol, and fresh produce, then
emphasize core items and comfort foods. Reprice
items to ensure they’re competitive under the new
market conditions. Build traffic by focusing on value
items first, then upselling.

development of solutions (Exhibit 5).
Shape the next normal
Instead of simply reverting to business as usual,
seize the opportunity to innovate in the next normal,
thus shaping not just your own company’s future but
that of the industry as well. Priorities should include
rethinking restaurant design, reinventing the menu,
assessing the store footprint, and digitizing the
customer experience.

—

Rethink restaurant design
To achieve post-COVID-19 growth, most
restaurants will need a redesign. Think about
whether to change your restaurants’ physical layout
to benefit from the shift to off-premise dining.
Layout changes might include the addition of drivethrough and pickup lanes, for example. Traffic flow
into and out of these zones will need to be carefully
thought through.

Reinvent the menu
Menu reinvention can be one of the most
powerful tools to change a restaurant’s long-term
performance trajectory. As consumer behavior
and sentiment continue to evolve, adapt your
menu accordingly. Closely monitor emerging food
trends, such as “clean” food, paleo diets, plantbased protein, and others. Introduce menu items
to capitalize on these trends, price those items
competitively, and market them to consumers.

Also, consider investing in advanced analytics
and automation, both to drive efficiencies and to
enable contactless services. Advanced analytics
and the Internet of Things (IoT) can improve your
ability to accurately forecast daily consumer
demand and changes in consumers’ eating habits.
Labor automation can increase the productivity of
restaurant processes as well as provide contactless
solutions that address consumers’ health concerns.
Some restaurants are already piloting a range of
technologies—such as robots that hand out takeout
orders, pulley systems at registers to facilitate
transactions with customers while maintaining
physical distancing, and smartscreen-controlled
shelves for storing pickup orders.

200

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 8, August 2020

Execute solutions. Implementation should
proceed in an agile way, addressing immediate
needs while also investing in distinctive longterm solutions.

— Adapt and sustain. Collect learnings and ideas
from teams to rapidly iterate and refine solutions
based on customer feedback.

Optimize your footprint
As you emerge from the crisis, you will need to
evaluate your store footprint and make tough
decisions about entering or exiting certain
geographies or shifting your strategies at a
local level (for example, converting a restaurant
to delivery/pickup only). Set up a footprintoptimization task force: a cross-functional team
that uses real-time internal and external data and
field observations to assess the health of specific
locations, then decides whether to enter, expand in,
or exit a market.

Digitize customer engagement
As mentioned, a shift toward off-premise dining
options and physical-distancing behaviors
will probably outlast the crisis. The digital
customer experience will be critical to retaining
current customers and capturing next-generation
loyalty, and the best way to enhance the digital
experience is through deep personalization.
Engage customers with personalized offers across
multiple digital channels; use customer data to
make decisions about merchandising, pricing,
and promotions.

The restaurant industry has faced severe challenges
during the pandemic, including sharp declines in
revenue and tremendous labor losses as well as
some permanent closures. However, at some point,
dining in restaurants will once again be a pleasure
that people across the country can enjoy. The actions
that restaurant operators take now will go a long way
toward preserving their business through the crisis
and equipping their restaurants to serve customers,
not just during—but also long after—the recovery.
