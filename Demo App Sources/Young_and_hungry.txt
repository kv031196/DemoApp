Young and hungry 
While India’s middle-class consumption story remains a strong long-term theme, we 
think the high-profile hygiene and personal care (HPC) subsector is already beyond 
the penetration phase, and further growth will have to be squeezed out from 
increasingly stiff competition. Traditional large HPC categories, such as soaps and 
detergents, have reached 90% or more penetration in both urban and rural markets. 
On the other hand, the organised food space continues to be underpenetrated at less 
than 25%, even in urban areas, and this is where we see the next big investment story 
as rising incomes seek out consumption upgrades and create demand for packaged 
foods, health foods and non-traditional cuisine. As economic growth spreads into the 
rural heartland, we think this trend will intensify. Our top picks on this theme are 
Jubilant Foodworks (exclusive franchisee for Dominos Pizza in India) and GSK 
Consumer (market leader in health drinks). We have two-year earnings CAGR 
forecasts of 36% on average for food companies, putting them significantly ahead of 
the HPC average of 14%. While current valuations for the food sector are at a 15% 
premium, we believe they should be higher given the longer-term opportunity.

 Action 
  We believe the food segment within the consumer sector will lead the next phase of 
growth, while hygiene & personal care (HPC) growth will be more muted due to 
greater penetration levels in urban and rural markets. Changing lifestyles, 
increased urbanisation, growing incomes and increasing need for convenience 
imply that packaged food will be a key growth driver for FMCG. We initiate 
coverage of SKB IN and JUBI IN with BUY calls and upgrade Nestlé to NEUTRAL.

 Catalysts 
  Superior earnings growth and better profitability will likely lead the food sector to 

grow faster than HPC and this will be reflected in P/Es, in our view.  

 Anchor themes 

We believe over the medium term, the food sector will grow faster than HPC in 
India from lower penetration and increased consumption. We are more upbeat on 
the long-term growth story of the food sector than that of HPC. 

Young and hungry   

 We prefer food over HPC  

Within India’s consumer sector, we believe food offers more long-term growth 
visibility than HPCs, and will likely lead sector growth over the next decade. Rising 
commodity costs, intensifying competition, high price elasticity of demand and 
deep penetration imply that growth in HPC over the long term may continue to lag 
that in the food sector.  

 Growth drivers in place  

We believe that the Indian food sector is likely to register steady sales growth in 
the high teens over the next decade on rising penetration, increasing urbanisation 
and lifestyle changes. Over the medium term, the food sector will likely also benefit 
from a shift towards branded and organised packaged foods.  

 Modern retail to play a critical role  

We believe that over the next decade, the evolution of modern retail will play a 
critical role in the growth rate of the food sector. A wider availability of products, 
focus on increasing consumption and supply chain efficiencies suggest faster 
growth prospects. Private labels will play a critical part in expansion of emerging 
categories, in our view.  

 Incumbent to have a strong advantage  

Given brand loyalty and rigid consumer preferences, we believe the incumbent 
advantage is strong in the food sector. Companies with strong mother brands have 
greater pricing power, which will likely help in combating commodity price inflation 
and maintaining profitability. 

 Jubilant and GSK consumer our preferred picks in food  

We believe that given strong incumbent advantage, GSK Consumer and Jubilant 
Foodworks will be the key beneficiaries and initiate on both stocks with BUYs. We 
upgrade Nestle to NEUTRAL (from Reduce) as valuations remain high.

Summary 

Executive summary  

India consumer: strong growth momentum… 

The FMCG industry in India has witnessed steady sales growth of a 12% CAGR over 
the past decade, according to AC Nielsen. Growth momentum picked up from a CAGR 
of 6% in FY01-05 and accelerated to 16% over FY06-FY10F. We attribute this to:  
1) acceleration in India’s GDP growth and favourable macro-economic conditions; 2) a 
sharp increase in rural incomes; and 3) a rising consumption culture. 

… Primarily aided by the food segment 

We believe that one of the most important facilitators for accelerating sector growth 
has been a significant pick-up in the processed and packaged food sector in India, in 
which sales have far outpaced HPC sales. Our analysis shows that the processed and 
packaged food sector (~46% of the industry) witnessed 19% sales growth in CY06-10, 
compared with 14% growth in the HPC segment and 16% growth in the overall FMCG 
industry. Mature HPC categories (top four categories: soap, shampoo, detergent and 
toothpaste) witnessed a sales CAGR of 13% during the same period.  

Food space underpenetrated  

While the Indian FMCG sector has witnessed rapid sales growth in the past few years, 
penetration rates across many categories are still low. While traditional large HPC 
categories, such as soap and detergent, have reached ~90% or more penetration in 
both urban and rural markets, the organised food space continues to be 
underpenetrated at less than 25%, even in the urban markets (source: AC Nielsen).  

Within the food category, even in bigger categories such as edible oil, there exists a 
vast untapped market. The share of organised food retail players in the edible oil 
market is low, which implies opportunities for branded players. As consumers in urban 
and rural areas continue to trade up to the branded segment, growth in the organised 
food space will likely remain strong, in our view. 

Food to lead sector growth  

The Indian FMCG industry will witness a sales CAGR of 10-12% over the next decade, 
according to Booz & Co estimates. However, we believe the mix will incrementally shift 
towards food from HPC. The share of emerging food categories could double in the 
overall FMCG space over the next decade, in our view, aided by: 1) strong growth 
within the existing emerging food categories, and; 2) the emergence of newer 
categories within this space such as mass market infant nutrition, healthy dairy, 
healthy evening snacks and pet food.  

Long-term growth drivers  

We believe the food sector will witness structural sales growth in the high teens over 
the next few years. Potential growth drivers are increased penetration and a shift 
towards the branded and organised sector, in our view.  

Untapped rural opportunity 

We think the rural opportunity for the food segment is largely untapped. While we 
acknowledge that this is on a much smaller base, rural India presents a great long-
term opportunity, in our view. Over the next few decades, rural incomes are likely to 
rise steadily on: 1) government-supported programmes such as the National Rural 
Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREG); 2) rising minimum support prices, and;  
3) improving information technology. Rising incomes would improve consumer demand 
in rural markets over the longer term, in our view.

Even urban markets are still underpenetrated 

We believe that there is still a large untapped market in urban India that will play an 
important part in overall food market expansion. Even in some of the large and long 
standing food categories such as ice-cream and chocolate, urban penetration is less 
than 30% (see the Exhibit below). This is an indication of the opportunity in the urban 
food space in India.

In our opinion, growth in urban markets is likely to be aided by: 1) steady rise in real 
disposable consumer incomes; 2) pick-up in the pace of urbanisation, and;  
3) accelerating “premiumisation”.  

Key challenges 

In our opinion, some of the potential challenges are: 1) a steady rise in food price 
inflation, which has averaged 11% over the past three years. This is perhaps a double-
edged sword, which hurts food companies’ profitability and consumer demand;  
2) food availability, which may also be an issue over the longer term, especially given 
that total food grain production only increased a marginal 3.2% CAGR over the past 
seven years, according to the Department of Agriculture; and 3) a low success rate in 
new food product launches.  

Trends 

Some of the key trends we foresee for the near to medium term:  

  Dining-in versus eating out: As the pace of urbanisation picks up leading to 

infrastructure bottlenecks, we believe that the concept of dining-in is likely to catch 
up. We believe that speed and convenience of a “take away “or “ordering-in” will be 
sufficient to make a large part of the population shift towards dining-in. This trend 
has started with most chain eateries (eg, McDonald’s and Subway) and standalone 
restaurants entertaining home delivery. This is one of the reasons for our Bullish 
view on Jubilant FoodWorks. 

  Steep innovation cycle: We see increased focus on innovation, especially by food 

companies in packaging (smaller and more affordable packs), product (mass 
marketing of premium categories), pricing, and category (emergence of many new 
categories). 

  Regulatory environment to get tougher: We believe that incrementally, the 

regulatory environment for food companies will get tougher with the implementation 
of the food safety and standard rule in 2011. We believe this will likely facilitate 
movement from the unorganised to the organised food sector. 

We are Bullish on India’s food space  

We prefer to have exposure to the food space versus HPC in India. We believe food 
offers more attractive longer-term growth opportunities with a number of categories still 
very underpenetrated. Our top picks in the sector: Nestlé (a market leader in chocolate 
and dairy), GSK Consumer (a market leader in malted beverage) and Jubilant 
Foodworks (an exclusive franchisee for Dominos Pizza in India with a 65% share of 
the pizza home delivery market, according to the company.  

We prefer companies in the food 
space vs. HPC

Growth has picked up from a CAGR of 6% in FY01-05 to 16% over FY06-FY10F. We 
attribute this to: 1) acceleration in India’s GDP growth and favourable macro-economic 
conditions; 2) a sharp increase in rural incomes; and 3) rising consumption culture.  

… primarily aided by the food segment 

However, a significant pick-up in growth of the processed and packaged food sector 
has also boosted that of the FMCG sector. Our analysis shows that the processed and 
packaged food sector (~46% of the FMCG market) witnessed 19% sales growth in 
CY06-10, compared with 14% sales growth in the HPC segment and 16% sales 
growth in the overall FMCG industry.

HPC has been the big laggard 

One of the other noticeable trends has been a significantly slower growth rate in the 
overall HPC segment, which has been lagging growth in the overall consumer sector. 
Within the HPC space, emerging categories have witnessed robust growth (category 
size almost doubled in four years), registering a 21% sales CAGR over CY06-10F.  

However, the mature HPC categories (comprising the top four categories in terms of 
size, ie, soaps, shampoos, detergents & toothpastes) witnessed a sales CAGR of 13% 
during the same period, below the sector average of 16% (source: AC Nielsen).

Consistency of growth food vs. HPC 

Another noticeable trend is that the consistency of growth has been much better in the 
food space vs that of the HPC segment. For instance, sales of the breakfast cereals 
market has grown by >25% pa over the past four years, Even a long-existing and more 
mature category such as chocolates grew an average of 15% during the same period. 
This compares with HPC categories such as detergent cakes, where sales growth has 
been inconsistent over the past three years, growing by 9-25% pa, while toothpaste 
growth has fallen over the last few years (FY08–FY10F) from 12% to 7%. We attribute 
this to: 

  Food segment is nascent: We believe that the primary reason for consistently 

higher growth is that the processed and packaged food segment is still nascent. As 
incomes have grown in the past few years and as health consciousness has 
increased for the urban consumer, this sector has witnessed acceleration in sales 
growth. We expect this trend to continue in the next few years.

On the contrary, large HPC categories are highly penetrated, especially in urban 
markets. Detergents, soaps and toothpastes all have ~90% or more penetration in 
the urban markets (source: AC Nielsen). This has led to structurally slower growth 
in these categories. Also, these categories have greater price elasticity, thus 
leading to lower brand loyalty. This impacts growth over longer periods of time. 

  Higher competition: The HPC segment is highly competitive with a slew of local, 

national and multinational players competing for a share of the pie. This means that 
unlike the food category, which is still in a growth phase, HPC is far more 
susceptible to price wars, in our view. This would also take a toll on the value 
growth category.

Penetration levels still low in 
many food segments across 
urban and rural India 

Foods & Beverages | India 

Manish Jain

State of play 

Where we stand today 
While the Indian FMCG sector has witnessed rapid sales growth over the past few 
years, penetration levels across many categories continue to be low. This makes us 
believe that growth in the sector is likely to continue at a steady pace over the next 
decade as more non-users convert to users.  

While traditional large HPC categories such as soaps and detergents have reached 
~90% or more penetration in both urban and rural markets, the food segment, 
especially emerging categories such as coffee, ketchup and milk powder continue to 
be significantly underpenetrated. Despite robust sales growth in the past few years, 
penetration for these categories, even in urban areas, continues to be less than 25%. 
Even in the relatively bigger food categories, which we define as categories that have 
existed for a long time such as biscuits, soft drinks and chocolate, penetration levels in 
urban areas are a long way from being saturated.  

Our assessment is high levels of penetration is the reason for the slowdown in these 
mature HPC categories. Also, this would mean that incremental growth in these 
categories can come only from consumers trading up to the branded segment and 
volume growth could further slow down over the next few years.  

Within the HPC space there are categories still at a nascent stage, such as deodorants, 
post wash hair care products, hand sanitizers and surface cleaners, which are likely to 
continue to grow strongly over the medium term. The issue here is size. According to 
AC Nielsen, these emerging HPC categories together account for just 5% of the FMCG 
market and may not add substantially to a company’s revenue for many years to come.  

Within the food segment, even in bigger categories such as edible oil, which appears 
near saturation on the surface, we believe there is still a vast untapped market. The 
share of organised players in the edible oil market is still under 70% with Marico having 
only a 3.4% share, according to the company, which implies attractive opportunities for 
branded players such as Marico in the medium term. Marico sees ~10% pa sustainable 
volume growth in the category. As consumers in urban and rural areas continue to trade 
up to the branded segment, sales growth in the branded category should remain strong 
over the next few years.

Industry dynamics very different 
in food and HPC 

Foods & Beverages | India 

Manish Jain

Industry dynamics 

Industry dynamics: food and HPC 
Following several meetings with players in the food and HPC space, we believe there 
are some structural differences in the operating environment between food and HPC. 
We highlight a few of these differences below: 

  Easier to experiment with HPC items compared with food: Consumer habits, 
especially when it comes to food, are difficult to change. However, the willingness 
to try out a new product is far higher when it comes to HPC products, according to 
Marico. Deodorants, post wash hair care products and surface cleaners are classic 
examples of successes.  

When it comes to food, consumers are extremely reluctant to experiment. On the 
ground feedback suggests that it usually takes a long time to successfully make 
people change their food habits. This is also demonstrated by the fact that some of 
the now successful categories have been in existence for more than a decade. For 
instance, instant noodles were first introduced to India in the 1980s and breakfast 
cereals in the 1990s.  

  Brand loyalty is low in HPC space: In our opinion, brand loyalty in the HPC 

space is extremely low even in some mature HPC categories, such as soaps and 
toothpastes. The best empirical evidence of this is the widely fluctuating market 
share among the three-four top players in soaps and shampoo and success of new 
entrants such as ITC.  

  Profitability same but shape of P&L different: Our discussion with various 

consumer companies gave us an indication of food and HPC businesses’ P&L. 
Food business players generally operate on a much lower gross margin, yet this in 
turn is compensated by lower advertising spending. HPC products typically have 
high gross margins, but because of high A&P spending, net margins are almost at 
par with food products. Some of the evidence of lower advertising spends by food 
companies:  

  According to TAM data, amongst the top 10 FMCG categories to be advertised 
across all three mediums (radio, print and television), food (ex aerated drinks) 
accounted for just 19% of total spending in 2010.  

  Amongst the top 10 FMCG advertisers, spending by pure food companies such 

as Cadbury and Nestlé accounted for just 12% of total spending in 2010. 

  Amongst the top three FMCG advertisers, HUL, ITC and Reckitt Benckiser, the 

share of food advertising was 7%, 39% and 0%, respectively, in 2010.      

  Supply chain: Food and HPC have vastly different supply chain needs. Some of 

the typical examples of supply chain issues that F&B companies face are:  

  Supply chain can be complicated in perishable items such as dairy products, for 
which cold storage facilities and temperature controlled vans are necessary. 

  Another issue is that manufacturing facilities of some products, such as chips 

and salty snacks, need to be closer to the market. This is largely because of the 
high freight cost involved. Hence, these companies typically need several small 
manufacturing facilities and they need to be closer to the target market to 
ensure profitability.  

  Another issue faced is that food items tend to have a significantly shorter shelf 
life. This means much quicker delivery systems, regular replenishment of 
products on the shelf, and vastly different distribution and storage requirements. 
In the F&B segment, shelf life can vary from seven days to three months on 
average, while in the HPC space the shelf life can be up to three years, say if 
the product is hair oil.

This is a key reason why some of the companies may prefer to continue to grow in 
one category only. For instance, Dabur has said it will continue to focus on its HPC 
portfolio over the medium term and real juices will be the only active F&B category 
it will continue to be in. 

  Taste is an important determinant: Our interaction across FMCG companies and 
modern retail participants threw up one common theme. Product taste in the F&B 
space is an important determinant for success. Even health products are made to 
satisfy a consumer’s taste bud with “health” benefits offered as an add-on. To give 
an example, Marico’s Saffola Zest, launched as a “healthy snack”, failed to appeal 
to consumers’ taste buds and was subsequently withdrawn. We also see this 
holding true with the continued success of Lays from PepsiCo and Bingo from ITC 
over the “healthier” Parle’s baked chips. Thus, the taste platform is winning over the 
health platform, certainly in the salted snacks segment, in our opinion.  

Companies have already learnt from such examples and are looking to pitch taste 
with wellness across new product offerings. Marico is looking to push its new 
Saffola Oats as a product that can be used to make traditional Indian breakfasts, 
such as upma or idli. We believe more companies will look to follow this and ensure 
their products appeal to the taste buds while not ignoring the health aspect. 

Learning from the HPC industry  

While food has outpaced HPC over the last few years in terms of sales, what’s 
interesting is that some of these mature HPC categories such as soaps have been 
able to register high single-digit to low double-digit growth in the past decade. This, 
while lower than the sector average, has to be viewed in the context of extremely high 
competition and relatively high penetration levels. This is where we believe that the 
food industry can learn some important lessons from the HPC players.  

In the shampoo segment (penetration increased from 40% in 2002 to 62% in 2010, 
according to Hindustan Unilever, growth was led by companies investing in 
breakthrough innovation (radical changes in packaging and introduction of small pack 
sizes) and consumer awareness. In order to tap the rural and in some way urban, 
companies introduced sachet packaging (pioneered by Cavinkare). This was an India-
specific pack size innovation, which led to a big improvement in penetration levels.  

The success of these HPC categories was driven by: 

  Innovation: Almost all or most growth in these large HPC categories are due to 
significant investments in research & development (R&D). HPC players have 
always made an effort to reinvent, from lowering pack sizes to introducing mass 
market formulations for premium products, to drive penetration.  

  Aggressive promotion: Companies realised the importance of driving usage 

among consumers and have thus spent significant amounts of money on consumer 
awareness. The rural markets were opened up, which added to the growth 
opportunity. Some of the specific example of such consumer awareness 
programmes are “project Shakti” by HUL and the “Oral health month” by Colgate-
Palmolive. 

  Conversion of non-users to users: Significant amounts have also been invested 
to grow the consumer base by converting non-users to users. Some of the specific 
examples of this have been oral care and hair care products. Traditionally, the rural 
population used soaps to wash hair; CavinKare with Chic changed that. Likewise, 
Colgate managed to drive more people to start using toothpaste instead of 
traditional “neem sticks” and toothpowders.

Competitive intensity stronger in 
the HPC space, while food is still 
a growing market 

Foods & Beverages | India 

Manish Jain

  Distribution: This has also been one of the key contributors in the success of HPC 
products. Companies such as HUL have made an effort to drive availability of these 
products across the length and breadth of the country. Over the last few years, 
companies such as HUL, GSK Consumer and GCPL have made significant 
investments, increasing the direct reach to the urban and rural markets to keep the 
growth trajectory intact.  

What we find interesting is that many of these factors are now playing out in the food 
space and we believe this may well be the growth engine of the next decade.  

Competition in food and HPC 
We have also looked at how competition has panned out in the food and HPC 
segments over the past few years. Here we find that competition has been more 
intense in HPC than in food, which we attribute to: 

  HPC categories near saturation: One of the key reasons for the higher 

competitive intensity in the HPC segment is that the top six categories have all 
reached near saturation. This means companies cannot rely on growing 
penetration (especially in the urban markets) and expanding the category to grow 
their businesses. In such situations, incremental growth only comes from share 
gains, in our view.  

This is exactly what appears to be panning out in the Indian HPC space. The HPC 
pie is large but not growing as fast and competition seems intense among foreign 
(likes of Unilever and P&G), national (Marico, Dabur and Godrej) and regional 
players (brands such as Gadhi, Ajanta and Anchor). We continue to see bouts of 
significantly heightened competition across HPC categories over the next few years 
as global players continue to fight over market share in India. This could impede 
growth on a periodical basis. 

  Food, however, is still a growing market: Market share at this time is less 
relevant in the food space. This is largely because in many of the categories, 
penetration levels are still very low. Industry players including modern retail 
participants are of the opinion that over the next few years, everyone will be happy 
to see the market grow.  

Several companies have launched products in the oats category, including Marico 
and Kellogg’s, over the past few months, but pricing across the board has been 
more or less standard. We believe the market share game in food categories is still 
a long way off, allowing competition to be more muted than in the HPC space.  

  Higher margins to play: As discussed, gross margins in the HPC space are much 
better than in food. This gives a HPC company a lever to invest significantly in 
advertising and promotions (A&P) with a view to gain market share. This is 
something already played out in the detergents segment in 2004 and in 2009, when 
HUL and P&G indulged in a price war with a view to gain market share, which 
subsequently led to significant margin cuts.  

What are the near-term implications?  

Mature HPC categories, such as soaps and detergents, have seen competition 
intensify. This has led to a rise in A&P spending and subsequent margin erosion. 
These are categories where penetration levels are high and consumers are more open 
to moving between brands. Competition has been largely price-led in these categories.  

While competition in the food space has also been increasing, it has not been at the 
same level as in the HPC space. Categories such as salty snacks, chocolates and 
dairy have all seen a number of new entrants, but most of the increased competition 
has been in advertising and promotion-led events. Price-led strategy has not been as 
relevant in the food space, meaning that the increase in category size is largely due to 
advertising investment by all the players. Margins have also held much better as a 
result since companies are in a better position to pass through rising input costs to 
consumers.

This has also been borne out by performance of HPC companies over the last few 
quarters. GCPL’s domestic business, which is largely soaps, home care and hair 
colours, has grown sales by an average 4.6% over the last four quarters, including two 
quarters of contraction. Marico, which mainly involves in edible and hair oils, has seen 
an average 11.3% sales growth while Colgate registered an average 13.4% growth. 
Contrast this with food companies such as GSK Consumer, which has seen an 
average sales growth of 20% over the last four quarters, while Nestlé has seen sales 
increase by 22.5%. A similar trend is also replicated on a longer-term time frame.  

Looking at HPC, we see near-term issues revolving around volume growth as well as 
margin pressures.  

  In categories such as soaps, detergents, shampoo and oral care, we believe sales 

growth will continue to slow due to high penetration and price elasticity.  

  High food inflation will likely lead to consumers cutting back spending on HPC 

items. This is likely to further hurt growth of HPC companies.  

  We believe that HPC categories will largely rely on aggressive pricing. This could 

have a further negative impact on volumes in the near term. 

In the food categories we see the following near-term implications 

  In categories such as instant noodles, biscuits, noodles, chocolates dairy products, 
volume growth continues to be strong and companies have some pricing power, 
suggesting that value growth is likely to be much ahead of that in the HPC space.  

  In terms of margins, having better pricing power and consumers being more 

acceptable of pricing in food products mean food companies will be better placed to 
manage cost pressures.  

Expect food to lead sector growth  

The FMCG sector has seen two phases of growth over the past decade. In the first 
half of the decade until 2005, the sector saw a slow CAGR of 6% before growth picked 
up significantly in the second half of the decade (CAGR of 16%). Many of the 
categories have grown ahead of the industry.  

According to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the consensus appears to be 
that the sector can easily clock in a CAGR of 10-12% over the next decade. However, 
if some of the bottlenecks such as FDI in multibrand retailing and the rollout of GST 
are removed, growth in the industry could see a much higher trajectory of closer to 
17%, according to Booz & Co estimates. Hence, whichever scenario pans out, we 
believe the industry’s outlook remains buoyant.  

However, within this potentially more attractive next phase of industry growth, we 
believe leading segments will be different. We believe the mix within the industry will 
shift towards food from HPC. Amongst the existing ones, more attractive segments are 
likely to be breakfast cereals, juices, packaged foods, dairy products, deodorants and 
hand sanitizer. 

We have looked at the total FMCG market and classified it into four broad categories, 
ie, food emerging, food others, HPC mature and HPC others. We have estimated 
growth for each of these categories to see how the shape of the industry will be in 
2020.  

In 2010, emerging food categories such as breakfast cereals, baby food and salted 
snacks were ~7.3% of total FMCG industry. We expect this to be the fastest-growing 
segment over the next decade, significantly outpacing growth in the industry. This 
means a decade later, emerging food categories could be ~13-14% of total industry.  

We believe this will be aided by two things: 1) strong pace of growth within the existing 
categories in emerging food, and; 2) emergence of newer categories within this space 
such as mass market infant nutrition, healthy dairy, healthy evening snacks, pet food

etc. India remains a young country (median age of population is 24 years, according to 
US census data) and there is a large market waiting to be provided with products in 
these categories.  

We believe even if the overall pace of the industry growth remains at 12% (which is the 
average of the last 10 years), the emerging food segment will grow much faster. If the 
industry growth is to exceed the average of the last 10 year, we believe the driver for 
this growth will come from other emerging food categories.  

While we believe food remains a more attractive space within the FMCG space 
compared to HPC, there are some HPC categories such as deodorants which we 
believe will also see robust, significantly higher than industry growth. However, we 
believe there are relatively fewer segments in the HPC emerging category (with 
significantly higher competition) and hence there is a more likelihood of emerging food 
categories delivering the next phase of growth vs the emerging HPC categories. 

Mature HPC categories is our least referred space (soaps, detergents, shampoo), as 
we believe they will likely lag behind in terms of growth and their profitability could also 
come under pressure as competition continues to remain strong. For instance, the 
detergents segment witnessed a collapse in profitability since the turn of the decade 
and has not gone back to those levels since. Shampoo is another segment where 
industry profitability has started to come down over the last few quarters, led by strong 
competition. Dabur, one of the bigger players in the shampoo segment, sees a 
structural downward shift in segment profitability over the longer term.

We prefer companies who are early leaders in the food space, such as Nestlé (leader 
in chocolates and dairy products) and GSK Consumer (leader in the malted beverage 
space). There are various macro- and micro-economic factors that will help support 
growth of these categories and we believe most of the factors are now in place.

Food industry all set for structural growth  

Long-term growth drivers in place  

Organised food market still in infancy  
We believe that the food sector is likely to witness structural growth in high teens over 
the next few years. We expect growth drivers of:  

  Increasing penetration: Penetration levels, across all categories, are still 

extremely low. While this is indeed true for emerging categories, penetration levels 
are fairly low even for some of the larger and long standing food categories. For 
instance, chocolate as a category is worth Rs27bn but the penetration level in 
urban areas is 28% and below 10% in rural areas, according to Godrej Consumer. 
We continue to see food consumption rising over the next few years.  

  Shift from unorganised to organised: Although we agree that per capita 

consumption is now relatively high in some of the food categories such as dairy 
products, staples, edible oils etc., we believe this will continue to grow over the 
medium term as demand for food continues to grow and consumers move from the 
unorganised to the organised segment. We have already seen this happen in the 
urban areas, where packaged milk and other dairy products witnessed a marked 
shift from the unorganised to the organised segment. We expect Nestlé and Marico 
to be the biggest gainers from this shift.  

Huge rural opportunity still to be tapped 
Over the last few years, despite strong growth witnessed in the rural markets, Indian 
FMCG companies continue to concentrate in these areas, especially in the food 
segment. HPC companies have realised the potential of the rural markets in the last 
couple of years and have steadily worked on improving rural penetration. This has 
caused rural growth in many HPC categories to come in higher than urban growth.  

However, as far as the food segment is concerned, the opportunity is still largely 
untapped. While we acknowledge that this is on a much smaller base, rural India 
presents a great long-term opportunity.  

Rural income: Steady rise ahead 

Over the last 18 years, per capita rural disposable incomes have steadily increased at 
a CAGR of 3.2% to ~Rs32,000, according to McKinsey Global. However, what’s 
interesting is that over the next few years, the pace of growth is likely to accelerate. 
According to estimates by McKinsey, rural disposable incomes are likely to increase at 
a CAGR of 4.2% over FY08-FY30. One of the biggest beneficiaries of this steady rise 
in rural incomes is likely to be the consumer sector and the food sector in particular, in 
our view.

While rural incomes are going to increase at a steady pace, the biggest beneficiary will 
be the rural middle class. According to McKinsey Global, the share of rural household 
with incomes between Rs0.2mn and Rs0.5mn is likely to rise to 22% in 2025 from 3% 
in 2005.

This increase in disposable incomes will continue to be supportive for FMCG 
companies, with penetration levels across several categories still very low in rural India. 
For example, soft drinks: 12%, Ice-cream: 9%, Milk powder: 3%. We believe the 
opportunity to grow penetration in these categories is one of the most attractive 
propositions for the FMCG industry. 

The increase in rural incomes can be attributed to a few factors.  

  Growth in minimum support prices: Over the last few years, there has been a 
marked increase in minimum support prices for agricultural crops from the Indian 
government. This has helped improve disposable incomes in rural areas as farmers 
benefitted from better prices for their produce.

  NREGA and other Government schemes: Government support for rural 

employment from schemes, such as the NREG, have significantly improved the 
income levels in rural areas. Wage increments under this scheme is now linked to 
inflation. This will help rural consumers have more disposable incomes. 
Construction activity under the government schemes has also helped, by directly 
providing employment and indirectly providing an end market for many ancillary 
industries in rural India. We have also seen this on our visits to various parts of 
rural India in the past few months.  

  Improving information technology: Over the past decade, farmers have better 
access to information on their produce prices, enabling them to eliminate various 
middle men and resulting in more income.  

Challenges in rural areas 

While we see rural India as a great opportunity for FMCG companies over the next 
decade, there are certain challenges that need to be overcome. We believe companies 
with a keen focus on rural India have already started to look at these challenges. 
Some of the issues that we have identified are: 

  Consumer awareness: One of the bigger challenges for companies in driving 

penetration of products in the rural areas is to ensure consumer awareness with 
regard to the existence of products and their utility. This is the first step in 
consumer engagement and it is the key driving factor to convince a consumer to try 
out the product, in our opinion. The advent of satellite television and subsequent 
penetration of TV in the rural areas has given companies a great platform to drive 
their message into rural India. Once the consumer is made aware of the product 
and its utility, the first battle is won. 

  Logistics: Another key issue is the setting up of supply chain and distribution 
system in rural areas. Many small towns and villages in India lack adequate 
infrastructure, a major bottleneck in setting up supply chain networks, in our view. 
Even after years of driving rural penetration, most companies are only able to 
directly cover about half of rural India. Logistics and supply chain will also depend 
on the kinds of product that a company wants to take to its consumer. For instance, 
it is easier to bring HPC products to consumers in rural areas, where the inherent 
shelf life is longer, while it is more difficult to take products such as milk, chocolate, 
and ice-cream, which have a shorter shelf life and need investments in cold storage 
facilities. However, the soft drinks example clearly shows how the investment in 
setting up the supply chain can be a rewarding experience.  

However, there are challenges to 
be overcome in rural areas 

Nomura

  Affordability: Once a consumer is made aware of the product and there is a 

supply chain in place to make sure the product reaches the consumer in the rural 
areas, typically the costs could have risen to high levels. The challenge for 
companies is to manage costs, as affordability of any product is an essential 
ingredient in driving the success of a product in rural areas. With per capita 
incomes much lower than in the urban areas, the percentage of population able to 
afford the product at the same price as in urban India is limited. However, with the 
concept of MRP (maximum retail price) in effect in India, companies will not be able 
to price differently in different areas. Companies that realised this have, over the 
past one decade, chosen to drive affordability by adopting smaller SKUs with lower 
price points. This is a strategy that has worked in products such as shampoo, for 
which the introduction of the sachet has led to a marked improvement in rural 
penetration. Going forward, we believe this is one of the key challenges for the 
industry in their efforts to drive rural penetration in many categories.  

Some relative success stories 

Companies which have been successful in driving penetration of their products in rural 
areas have overcome the above-mentioned challenges. The onset of satellite 
television has made the job of attracting consumers’ interest in rural areas much easier. 
Companies have used this to their advantage and drive local area-specific strategies 
to help further improve the relevance of the product at the regional level.

We believe one of the biggest successes in rural areas has been the shampoo sachets. 
Rural penetration in the shampoo category was very low in the early 2000s. However 
as companies made a push into rural areas, this was a key innovation they identified 
which helped significantly drive rural penetration of the product. Advertising made 
consumers more aware of the product and companies invested in distribution to push 
the product to smaller towns and villages. In addition, with the product priced 
reasonably, it saw a big success across rural India.  

Likewise, the biscuit category, with a combination of advertising and affordable pricing, 
saw its market size grow many times over the last one decade.  

Recent successes are Maggi’s chotu (priced at Rs5 each) and Cadbury's dairy milk 
shots (priced at Rs2 each). Both products had an aspirational value attached to them, 
but because of the price points, they were offered in urban India and the affordability 
factor failed to work for rural consumers. However, both companies realised this and 
after having made pricing more relevant with smaller SKUs, recently drove significant 
penetration in the rural areas.  

Even urban markets are still fairly underpenetrated  

As mentioned earlier, under-penetrated rural markets are an attractive opportunity for 
the food sector in India and we expect this market to account for a large part of 
incremental growth over the next few years. However, as far as the food sector is 
concerned, we believe that there is still a large untapped market even in urban India, 
which we believe will play a very important part in overall food market expansion.  

In some of the large and long standing food categories such as ice-creams and 
chocolates, the urban penetration level continues to be lower than 30%. This is a good 
indication of the huge opportunity in the urban food space in India, in our view.

Urban disposable income to accelerate 

Over the last 18 years, per capita urban disposable incomes have steadily increased 
at a CAGR of 5.4%, significantly ahead of the rural incomes. According to estimates by 
McKinsey, over the next few years, growth of urban disposable incomes is likely to 
accelerate, at CAGR of 6.4% over FY08-FY30. With steady rising incomes and the 
culture of consumerism increasing, we believe that there is significant opportunity in 
the food sector.

India will show a strong rise over

Pace of urbanisation to pick up significantly  

Over the last one decade, we have seen increasing trends of urbanisation and we 
expect this to remain in the next decade. The fastest-growing states will continue to 
exhibit the highest urbanisation rate, in our view. By 2008, an estimated 340mn people 
would have already lived in urban India, representing ~30% of the total population. 
However, McKinsey estimates suggest that over the next 20 years, 70% of all the 
incremental jobs created in India are likely to be in urban India and these jobs are 
likely to be twice as productive as the equivalent jobs in rural India. Thus, the 
population in India’s cities will increase to 590mn or 40% of India’s population will live 
in cities in 2030, on McKinsey estimates. 

This pace of urbanisation, both in terms of speed and scale, has been unprecedented 
and has not been witnessed anywhere in the world except in China. More importantly, 
the urbanisation will be fairly well spread out, impacting almost all the states. The five 
largest states (Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Punjab) are likely to 
have urbanisation rates in excess of 50% by 2030, according to McKinsey.   

Urbanisation trends will help 
growth in the food sector

Likely to lead to accelerating premiumisation  

One of the consequences of increased urbanisation is accelerating “premiumisation”. If 
urban disposable incomes increase nearly four fold in the next 20 years, then 
consumer preference is undoubtedly going to shift towards premium products, in our 
view. 

This rapid premiumisation has been prevalent in India’s urban markets over the last 
few years. One of the best empirical evidence of this is that almost all the companies 
under our coverage continue to report improved product mix, signalling up trading by 
consumer. Along with rising incomes and affordability, this is also a function of rising 
consumer aspiration. The upper middle class wants to emulate the rich and trade up 
towards higher-priced products.  

Improved purchasing power of Indian consumers is supported by greater participation 
of women in the workforce and increased number of younger workers, who are more 
willing to spend on lifestyle products. These factors will gradually combine to give a 
considerable push to premiumisation in the future, in our view, making it more 
pronounced compared to the last one decade. Continued favourable age distribution is 
also likely to be a driver for premiumisation in the future. 

There are several examples of consumers trading up to more premium products, as 
well as FMCG companies launching various products to capture the premium market: 

  Dove, a premium brand from HUL, increased its market share from 0.1% in 2005 to 

~ 5% in 2010 in the hair care products category.  

  L’Oreal has witnessed rapid growth in India with an ~8% market share in cosmetics, 
climbing up to the third position in this category. Similarly for hair colour, L’Oreal 
now occupies a 20% share of the market. 

  P&G’s Olay (premium anti-ageing skin-care brand) has now captured a 20% 

market share within one year of its launch. 

Some evidence of this is also visible within the modern retail outlets in the top six cities. 
Within the F&B space, the share of luxury and imported products is significantly higher. 
The gourmet food bazaar (see pictures below) is the best example of this.

Urban consumer driving 
consumption in food

Companies will be faced with the twin challenge of having to separate strategies for 
the urban and rural consumes over the next couple of decades. We believe the real 
winners will be companies that are able to tap these opportunities separately. Some of 
the categories which we believe will drive consumption in urban India over the next 
decade are Cereals, Fruit Juices, etc. 

Urban consumer driving consumption in food 

Processed and packaged food continues to be largely an urban category with most 
products having little or no penetration in rural markets. However, the demand from 
urban consumers has seen a sharp increase over the past few years, aided primarily 
by growing consumer incomes, increasing urbanisation and preference for 
convenience. This is likely to continue over the next few years, as consumers 
increasingly are looking for options which could make their meals more exciting as well 
as convenient.  

This phenomenon will have particular relevance for categories such as breakfast 
cereals, for which the demand is likely to sustain over the long term, as producers of 
breakfast cereals have already responded to consumers’ increased concerns over 
health and the growing trend for convenience by investing heavily. Our interactions 
with FMCG companies as well as modern retail participants suggest that the primary 
concern for companies at this stage is to build a presence in the category. Breakfast 
cereals in India, worth Rs5bn, is a small market in the context of the overall FMCG 
market, of which Oats is now worth Rs1.5bn, according to Marico.

Newer and emerging categories to grow fastest 

We believe growth in the food segment will also be driven from emerging categories 
such as juices, milk powder, baby foods, etc. With consumer preference moving 
towards convenience and with a large percentage of the wallet still being spent on food, 
these product categories are primed to take off, especially in urban areas.  

Some of the best examples of this are breakfast cereals and packaged juices. Both 
categories are relatively new to the Indian market, but are growing at a fast clip. We 
expect breakfast cereals to deliver a medium-term growth rate of 20-25% and juices to 
continue to grow strongly over the next few years.  

To put this into perspective, the breakfast cereals market is worth Rs5bn and juices is 
worth Rs15bn, according to AC Nielsen. Also note that in both these categories, 
consumers are moving from home-made/ unbranded products to packaged products. 
With demographics supportive for such a move, we see a big shift from unbranded 
products to packaged drinks. In the juices segment, Coca Cola India suggests that 
only 90mn cases out of the 660mn cases of juices market volume are packaged. This 
clearly leaves plenty of room for growth over the medium term. The first phase of this 
move has already started to happen, with packaged drinks moving from under 10% of 
the total juice market to 16-17% today (source: Coca Cola India).  

We believe that modern retail is going to play a big role in the growth rates of these 
categories, given the high share of wallet and products being largely urban centric. We 
believe more of these emerging categories will be in the food space and that is where 
we find the most attractive opportunity across FMCG in India.

A case study: A food v/s HPC giant  

A tale of two giants: HUL vs Nestlé India  
The growth trajectory of these two sectors (ie, food and HPC) in the last few years has 
certainly had a deep impact on the fortunes of the companies in the respective sectors. 
Intuitively speaking, food sector companies such as Jubilant foodworks and Nestlé 
have done far better (in terms of growth, profitability and extending their leadership 
position) than leading HPC companies such as HUL, Colgate-Palmolive, Godrej 
Consumer etc, in our opinion.  

This is also corroborated by industry data of the last four years. Food companies under 
our coverage have registered an average revenue growth of 20% in the last 18 
quarters, a clear outperformance of 6% compared to the HPC companies.  

In terms of profitability, the average operating margin of food companies stood at 
19.6%, almost 270bps higher than the average profit margin of HPC companies.

In this section, we have also tried to back test our thesis by analyzing the operational 
details of HUL (an HPC giant) and Nestlé (a leading processed food player).  

Nestlé India: A leading processed and packaged food player in India with strong 
presence in growing segments such as instant noodles, dairy products and beverages 
amongst others.  

Hindustan Unilever: HUL is by far the biggest play in the HPC segment in India with a 
strong leadership position in segments such as soaps, body wash, fabric care, hair 
care and skin care. While HUL does have a meaningful presence in the food segment, 
recent efforts have met with less than expected success, resulting in the share of food 
diminishing in the overall revenues.  

Growth and profitability: Nestlé wins hands down  

The impact of being in two different segments is clearly visible on Nestlé India’s growth 
profiles over the few years. Nestlé India’s revenues have registered a CAGR of 22% 
(more than doubling in the process) in the past four years, while HUL registered a 
modest CAGR of 9%. As a result, HUL’s revenue, used to be 4.4x that of Nestlé, is 
now just 2.8x of Nestlé’s.  

The impact of profitability has been even starker. Nestlé registered a 27% CAGR 
(margin improvement of 40bps in the past four years) in profits, while HUL registered a 
CAGR of 5% (margin decline of 120bps in the past four years) during the same period. 
As a result, HUL’s PAT, which used to be 6x that of Nestlé, stands at just 2.8x that of 
Nestlé’s.

Competition: a consistent issue with HUL  
India’s consumer sector is one of the fastest-growing markets globally, thus attracting 
a lot of new players. While there has been a significant rise in overall competitive 
intensity in the last few years, the degree and the resultant impact vary among sub-
segments. We believe that the surge in competitive intensity has hurt HPC companies 
far more than food players.  

Within the HPC space, HUL has been under three pronged attacks from international 
competitors (companies such as Reckitt Benckiser, Proctor & Gamble amongst others), 
large national players (companies like ITC in key segments such as soaps, skin and 
hair) and regional brands (brands such as Ajanta, Anchor, Ghadi). Large HPC 
categories such as body wash, hair care and skin care together represent almost one-
third of the consumer market and in a growing phase, everyone wants a piece of the 
pie. The problem gets compounded for large players, such as HUL, since they have 
strong leadership and every time competition increases they feel the maximum impact.  

There is no denying that competition has also increased in the food space; however, 
the key difference is that the category is growing at a very rapid pace and thus the 
competition does not hurt to the same degree.  

Price wars: permanent damage to profitability  

One of the consistent themes in the HPC space has been that on a periodic basis, 
competitive intensity flairs up, leading to a price war between key players. HUL has 
engaged in two extremely damaging price wars in the past few years. The first was in 
2002-04 when it engaged with P&G in the fabric care and hair care segment and with 
Colgate in the oral care segment, which resulted in price cuts of around 30-50%, which 
permanently damage the industry’s profitability. The second price war was more recent 
(in CY09-10) and primarily limited only to the laundry category. 

The impact on a company’s profitability is fairly evident. On our estimates, from a 
sustained 18-19% EBITDA margins they have now come down to the 13-14% range.

Traditional HPC companies have failed to strike a balance between profitability and 
growth, in our opinion. In a quest to defend its leadership position, HUL has always 
been willing to sacrifice profitability. The company has time and again mentioned that 
this strategy is unlikely to be changed in the near future.  

In the food space, while competition has increased with the entry of players such as 
Danone and ITC, it has not been price-led. Most of these categories are still growing 
and fairly under penetrated. The competition has been limited to some promotions but 
not really on pricing. On the contrary, companies in the dairy products business have 
consistently hiked prices in the past few months to offset input cost pressures.

Food segment has its own 
challenges 

Foods & Beverages | India 

Manish Jain

Opportunity attractive… but stiff challenges ahead!  

Challenges in the food space 
While the opportunity in the food space is very attractive over the next decade, there 
are also some important challenges that the segment needs to overcome to grow 
faster than the overall consumer sector. We have identified some of the key 
challenges, which may be an impediment to sector growth. 

Food inflation a cause for concern  

One of the key challenges that lies ahead for companies in the Indian consumer sector is 
sustained high food inflation. Over the near to medium term, this may hit the companies 
in two possible ways: 1) margin pressure as commodities such as milk, wheat, sugar etc 
witness an unprecedented price rise, and; 2) consumer demand may be hit as wallets 
come under a squeeze. Historically, there has been a strong correlation of high inflation 
and consumers trading down. This is especially true for high involvement (of consumer 
mind share) food products such as cooking oil which faced a significant demand slump in 
2009 in the premium segment due to unprecedented price hikes.  

Over the past few years, food inflation in India has trended up steadily. While part of 
this is due to rising global food prices, there are also some India-specific factors such 
as inadequate monsoon in 2009 and supply chain issues, such as loss due to pilferage, 
lack of proper storage and distribution, among others.  

Our analysis suggests that food inflation is now becoming structural in nature. For 
instance, average food inflation was 4% between CY00 and CY08; since then, it has 
shot up to 11%.

Our interactions seem to suggest that the industry is aware of this issue and that there 
is a growing acceptance that food inflation could be structural in nature.  

This, in essence, means affordability of food will continue to go down among some 
consumer classes, which is not a good sign for the near to medium term and is 
definitely a challenge for the industry, in our view.  

When we look at household spending on food as a percentage of total income, we see 
India as among the highest in the world. This is clearly a result of high food inflation 
and GDP per capita growth not being able to catch up with food inflation. In developed 
economies, the share of food as a percentage of total household income can be as low 
as 20% (see the Exhibit below).

Going into the next few years, we believe that a key challenge for the food companies 
will be to keep their product affordable, especially for the mass markets, to enable 
conversion from non-users to users and from unorganised to organised.  

However, food companies have greater pricing power 

We believe one of the key differentiations between the food and HPC segments is 
pricing power of a company. In the food space, companies such as Nestlé and GSK 
consumer have on average hiked prices by 8-10% over the past three years, but 
volume growth has continued to remain strong. Jubilant Foodworks said it would hike 
prices by 5% on average each year, which has been accepted by its consumers. 

Contrast this with HPC names such as HUVR, whose pricing actions have a strong 
inverse relationship with volumes as witnessed in FY10, when the company took large 
price increases across its portfolio and saw volumes being hit significant. As the 
company reduced prices at the start of FY11, volume growth has come back strongly, 
but profitability has dropped significantly.  

We believe food companies have greater pricing power largely on account of two 
reasons: 

  The organised food industry in India still largely caters to the urban population, of 
which incomes are growing and consumers are more willing to pay a higher price 
for a product. 

  Consumers cannot cut back their spending on food as they tend to do for HPC 

products in a period of high food inflation. Consumers, being used to higher prices

for basic food commodities, are also willing to pay higher prices for packaged foods 
than cut consumption. 

Food availability may also be an issue 

Another key challenge that the sector is likely to face is availability of food. Going by 
the total production data, food supply in India has been largely steady over the last few 
years, significantly below its consumption growth. This, incidentally, has also been one 
of the key reasons for steady food inflation.  

Just to give some examples, total food grains production has witnessed a marginal 
3.2% CAGR over the past seven years, with principle commodities such as rice and 
wheat also growing at the same pace. Sugarcane production, on the other hand, has 
actually declined marginally.

Our belief is that consumption has increased at a much more rapid pace. While there 
is no data to back our claim, we believe that population growth hovering at 1-1.5% 
would mean that consumption growth is far more rapid.  

Also, in the last fifteen years, 46mn new people have entered the consumption class 
(age 5-20), according to the US Census Bureau. We believe this is another indication 
of consumption rising at a fairly rapid pace.

Another indication of consumption increasing at a rapid pace is that according to a 
report by NGOs “US AID” and “CARE INDIA”, there has been an 8% decline in 
malnutrition cases in nine poorest states across India in the past seven years. A large 
part of the credit has been given to the government’s ‘Aanganwadi’ scheme.

Also worth noting that India is a market where there is a significant amount of loss due 
to pilferage and wastages as infrastructure (setting up of storage facilities) remains 
inadequate and faulty. While there are no reliable estimates for how much of the 
production is lost due to pilferage, storage and transportation, the Food Corporation of 
India said that 18.3mn tonnes of wheat, 39.5mn tonnes of rice, 22,000 tonnes of paddy 
and 110 tonnes of maize were damaged between 1997 and 2007 due to supply chain 
issues. We would highlight non-availability of adequate storage facilities and loss due 
to pilferage, etc. as one of the key constraints for availability of food in the country.  

Thus, with production not being able to keep pace with consumption, food supply and 
prices are likely to be an issue in the near to medium term in India.  

Global consumption of food is expected to go up over the next decade, with growth in 
developing countries far outpacing the growth in developed countries. If production 
does not keep up with the increased demand, we could see food prices continue to 
rise in the next decade.

Success rate in new food product 
launches is lower than in HPC 

Low success rate in new food product launches 

We believe that one of the key challenges that lie ahead for companies is the relatively 
low rate of success in new food product launches. Compared to the HPC space, the 
success rate in new food product launches has traditionally been significantly lower. 
This is one issue we believe that companies are likely to continue to face in the near to 
medium term.  

There are several issues in food which means that success rate is less than in HPC 
products. Some of the key issues are:  

  Food habits are difficult to change: Empirical evidence suggests that consumers 
are far more willing to experiment when it comes to HPC items such as soaps, 
shampoos, etc. However, when it comes to making sustainable changes in their 
food habits, people are usually fairly hesitant. This is one of the key reasons that 
most successful launches in the food space have taken a relatively longer time to 
achieve critical mass.  

  Health and vitality important, but not at the cost of taste: Another important 
thing, we believe, is to combine taste with health. This has been one area where 
most of the food players have struggled. Feedbacks from several companies 
suggest that while consumers are increasingly becoming health conscious, they still 
are not ready to sacrifice taste. This makes inroads, especially into new 
products/categories, difficult. 

  One country-one solution approach does not work: “Indianising” / 

“regionalising” is of paramount importance when it comes to the food sector. India 
is a country where its population has many different tastes and preferences. Thus, 
a product needs to adapted/tweaked/changed to suit many different palates. This is 
one issue particularly faced by MNC players and often has regional players scoring 
over them.

There have been plenty of examples of food products that have not worked in India. 
HUL’s first foray into the instant noodles segment was a failure. Marico’s Saffola Zest 
only had moderate success before the product was being withdrawn. Nestlé’s Milo, 
which is a very popular product worldwide, had failed to do well in India and was 
withdrawn. Nestlé’s other products probiotic Yogurt etc. have met with moderate success.

There have also been some great successes in the food space. Some of the brands 
which have been successful in new food product launches have been able to create a 
new category, with the result that some of these brands still have a large percentage

Some of the common features that have made all the earlier-mentioned products 
successful are:  

  Most/all the successful product launches have taken a significant amount of time to 

achieve critical mass.  

Nomura 

34

21 February 2011 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Foods & Beverages | India 

Manish Jain

  Quite a few of the recent launches have been in the “healthy food” space. This 
underlines the increasing emphasis by consumer, especially in urban India, on 
health and wellness. 

  Most/all the products are still largely present in urban India. Food is still a fairly 

small and nascent category in rural India.  

Going forward, we believe the comparative low rate of success in new food product 
launches will likely be a big hurdle for consumer companies in the food segment. 
These companies will need to be prepared to face failures and will need substantial 
funding to invest in brands over a long period to achieve success.  

Heterogeneity of the market is a big challenge 

India is a heterogeneous market with consumer tastes and preferences changing 
every few miles. This makes it difficult to come up with a single product to satisfy the 
needs of consumers throughout India. Saffola Arise from Marico, launched at the start 
of the year, only has had moderate success in the North and East India, where 
consumer preference has always been for long grain rice. Where consumer preference 
has been for short grain rice like in South India, the product has done well. 

This is a point which was also echoed by Pantaloon, and is also something it sees as a 
key challenge even in organised retail. Tastes and preferences across the country are 
very different and this means strategy across stores, sometimes even in the same city 
has to be different. For instance, there are stores in Bangalore which sell a traditional 
Maharashtrian savoury called ‘bhakarwadi’, catering to a large percentage of Marathi-
speaking population in Bangalore for their weekly grocery shopping. There is also a 
special variety of Bengali rice sold stores in Delhi, which is very popular with the 
Bengali-speaking population in Delhi. Even within the same city, stores which are a 
few kilometres apart have a different target audience. For example, a store in Mumbai 
would have specials around the Diwali holiday in November while another store would 
have specials near the Eid festival, although both festivals are only days apart.

Indian consumer still evolving 

Another key hurdle that Indian food companies are likely to face is the process of 
evolution by Indian consumers. While awareness levels of Indian consumers have 
gone up, a large part of consumption habits are still dictated by traditional beliefs and 
habits, in our opinion.  

In our interactions with industry participants, we have learnt this phenomenon is 
particularly visible when the Indian consumer’s buying behaviour of staple items is 
observed. Across retail stores, including large modern retail stores in metros, many 
consumers still prefer to touch and feel the staples before making their buying decision. 
To this day, a vast majority of staple sales across retail chains occurs on a loose basis 
compared to pre-packed staples. This is especially surprising given that there is 
marginal/ no difference in prices and hygiene is an important element involved.  

This is a losing proposition for both retailers (increased man power costs, increased 
space consumption) and consumers (hygiene compromised in loose staple sales), yet 
80% of the staple sales for large retailers happen on a loose basis.  

This is just one example of the challenges faced by Indian food companies. Indian 
food companies would need to posses a deep understanding of their customers’ 
traditions and beliefs and be agile enough to respond quickly to the evolving consumer 
needs.

Trends going forward will include 
dining in vs eating out

Looking ahead… the next decade 

Future trends 

Dining in vs eating out 

Another key trend that we see catching up significantly in the next decade is the 
concept of dining in, especially in urban India. As mentioned earlier, the pace of 
urbanisation is likely to pick up significantly in the next few years. This would mean 
that urban India is likely to see a significant increase in its population, with the top 
seven cities having more than 10mn inhabitants. According to McKinsey estimates, 
India is likely to have 68 cities with a population of more than 1mn by 2030 compared 
to 42 cities today.  

This population explosion is likely to lead to severe issues such as adequacy of public 
transport and road infrastructure.

This infrastructure bottleneck, combined with urban lifestyle, is likely to lead to a 
significant part of the eating out population migrating to “dining In”. We believe that 
speed and convenience (no long drives, no parking hassles and no waiting in long 
queues for a table) of a “take away “or “ordering in” are sufficient to make a large part 
of the population shift towards dining in over a period of time.

This trend has already started in a significant manner with most of the chain eateries 
(McDonalds, Subway, etc) and standalone restaurants now providing home delivery 
services.  

In the longer term, while eating out should command a significant share of sales 
growth, we believe that a large part of the incremental growth is likely to be driven by 
Quick Service Restaurants (QSR). This is one of the key reasons for our Bullish view 
on Jubilant FoodWorks.   

Competition continues to rise 

One of the challenges that will continue to affect Indian food companies will be a 
steady rise in competition, in our view. This has been a steady phenomenon in the last 
few years but the pace of new food product launches seemed to pick up significantly in 
2010. Some of the examples of product launched/plans in 2010 are as below:  

  ITC recently entered the noodles space with its brand “Sunfeast Yippee!”. This 

marks the third entry in the noodle space in recent times after HUL (Knorr Soupy 
Noodle) and GKS Consumer (Foodles). We believe this will make things 
incrementally tougher for Nestlé.  

   GSK consumer healthcare also recently entered the biscuits & cookies segment, 

apart from health bars, in a bid to diversify its product profile. 

  The global food giant, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) also has robust plans to 
grow its business in Maharashtra. Currently, the company has three stores 
operating in Mumbai and one in Pune. It plans to move this to ~30 stores by FY12.  

  Recently, global breakfast player Kellogg entered the oats segment in India. This 
space is already significantly crowded with companies such as Bagrry, Marico and 
Pepsi. 

  Costa Coffee plans to expand its footprint in the country significantly. According to 
the company, it plans to open one store every 15 days to take the total store count 
to 75 by the end of the year. 

  Global giant Danone recently entered the Indian markets with a range of dairy 
products. This again increases competition for companies such as Nestlé. 

  Chocolate maker Ferrero Rocher has announced plans to expand its presence in 

the Indian confectionary segment.     

Hence, we believe that incumbent advantage is significant in this segment. While in 
the near term this is unlikely to hurt Indian food companies, as the food space in India 
is still growing, we believe that in the longer term, Indian food companies need be 
careful of this issue.  

Innovation is key to success  

Another key trend we see going forward is increased focus on innovation, especially 
by food companies. Some of the key innovation trends we expect to form are:  

Innovation pipeline will be the key 
to success 

  Packaging innovation: We believe this has taken shape significantly in the past 

few years, but we see scope to increase significantly in the coming decade. If food 
penetration has to increase in rural India, then affordability is key. One of the 
easiest ways of making a product more affordable is to reduce the pack size.  

We believe the trend of packaged and processed food in affordable smaller packs, 
ie, PPP (popularly priced packs) is going to pick up significantly in the coming years. 
The Chotu Maggie (priced at Rs5 each) is a good example of this innovation.  

  Product innovation: Product innovation is likely to be key to success in India’s 
urban markets. Urban consumers are now increasingly getting more and more 
health conscious. Thus, all new introductions in the urban food space will 
necessarily need to address the question of health and vitality without 
compromising on the taste front, in our opinion.

  Pricing innovation: As mentioned earlier, affordability is key to success for many 
product categories. Unfortunately, not all products can be marketed in smaller 
packs. For instance, infant nutrition is not one that can be sold just on a trial basis, 
as either the consumer is going use it regularly or not. Thus, the key challenge for 
the companies is to innovate and bring in mass-market versions to ensure higher 
affordability.  

  Category innovation: We believe that there is a lot of latent potential in the Indian 
food market and there is an existing demand for several products which are either 
not freely available in the market currently or the categories are just too small. Food 
companies will need to focus their energies on such products going into the next 
few years, in our view. Some of these categories are mass market infant nutrition, 
healthy dairy, healthy evening snacks and pet food.  

  Multi category positioning: Another important innovation that we see companies 
focussing on is multi category positioning. This in essence means introducing new 
products in a manner which makes them relevant in more than one category, For 
instance, Unibic India is in the process of launching Chyawanprash cookie. This 
distinct positioning gives them the opportunity to tap consumers both in the cookie 
market and the Chyawanprash segment. Unibic India is a small player in the 
biscuits segment in India and we believe one way of establishing itself is innovation 
of products currently not launched by other players.  

Another example of a different kind of multi category positioning is Kellogg’s. The 
company has become a market leader in the breakfast cereals market in India, but 
lacked a presence in the evening snack category. Packaging innovation with the 
Rs10 per pack placed alongside the salty snack packs has put the company’s 
existing product into another category. 

These innovations will further add to the overall category growth as newer 
consumers come into the category. We believe this will not be a threat to the 
existing categories such as Chyawanprash, which will likely continue to grow. 

Regulatory environment to get tougher 

We believe that incrementally the regulatory environment for Indian food companies is 
likely to get tougher, even though implementation in the near term may be an issue. A 
couple of recent examples are outlined below:  

Food safety and standard rules, 2011 

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recently issued a draft for food safety and 
standard rules, which will become the Food Safety and Standards Act (FSS1) and will 
come into force over the next few months. FSSA is an all-encompassing act that seeks 
to regulate every aspect of the food industry right from manufacturing, storage, 
warehousing and transportation to packaging and labelling.  

This will ensure that the overall focus on food safety and regulations behind the 
packaging and sale of food products will increase across the country. While intuitively, 
this appear to be negative as costs related to complying with these regulations will 
increase, we believe the incremental costs for organised players will not be 
significantly higher as most players are already following many of these guidelines 
voluntarily. However, this would be highly positive as the so far unregulated 
unorganised food industry would also come under the purview of the act. This would 
enable a smooth and slow transition of consumers from the organised to the 
unorganised sector.

Some of the key takeaways from the draft and the 2010 regulations are: 

  Stricter regulations concerning packaging materials used for all kind of food 

products, especially for high risk products such as fish, meat, fresh fruits and 
vegetables, poultry and eggs, among others.  

  More information on the labels to be shared with consumers detailing among other 
things ingredients used, declaration of food additives, addition of colour and added 
flavours.  

  Edible oils packaging must be free of exaggerated claims such as ‘Ultra-Refined’, 
‘Anti-Cholesterol’, ‘Cholesterol Fighter’, ‘Soothing to Heart’, ‘Cholesterol Friendly’, 
and ‘Saturated Fat Free’. 

  Although we have cited only a few examples above, what is clear is that the 

Ministry of Health is clearly focused on making sure that food products are safe for 
consumers. We see this as a catalyst for a crackdown on growth of the 
unorganised packaged food segment, which could mean a shift in demand to the 
organised segment.  

We believe the focus on food safety and bring more regulations in the sector will be a 
longer-term positive, as this helps ensure products are safer for consumers and proper 
information is available. As consumer awareness increases over the next few years, 
these regulations will likely signal a shift in consumer choice from the unorganised to 
the organised segment and growth of packaged foods will likely continue to see a 
significant rise. We would point to the branded milk and packed curd as two products 
where the share of organised in the overall segment has increased significantly over 
the last few years. We see a further shift over the next few years, especially as 
consumers are becoming more aware of the health issues surrounding packaged 
foods. Some of the other categories which will see benefit from this are chocolates, 
packaged meat, staples etc.  

Food safety pledge to also come into force soon 

In 2009, seven companies in the food and beverages space, namely Hindustan 
Unilever, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé, Kellogg’s, Mars and General Mills decided to 
sign the India Pledge on the lines of the pledge signed in the European Union. The 
pledge gave guidelines to restrict and regulate propagating unhealthy foods. The 
pledge was to demonstrate their commitment to social responsibility in marketing food 
and beverage products to children, provide a framework to promote healthier dietary 
choices and more active lifestyles to children.  

The deadline to get this pledge signed was 31 December, 2010. Although the deadline 
has been missed, we expect this to be out soon as companies remain committed to 
the idea.  

India will be the 12th country to have food and beverage companies coming together to 
sign the pledge. Countries where similar pledges have been signed include the US, 
Canada, Australia, Thailand, South Africa and Brazil.  

The pledge is coming to India after it has already been in place in several other 
countries. In Europe, companies including Nestlé, Danone and Unilever have signed 
the pledge. This has entailed a higher cost as companies have to spend additional 
money to ensure that the information on labels etc is not misleading. We see the 
increased regulations in the food space having a cost, but being more beneficial for 
longer-term growth of the organised food sector.

Modern retail will play a key role 
in the development of the FMCG 
sector

Role of modern retail 

Evolution of modern retail key to driving FMCG sales 
Modern retail, which has only really developed in India over the last few years, is still in 
a fairly nascent stage. However, what has been impressive has been the rapid pace of 
growth, especially in the urban markets where some estimates suggests that modern 
retail penetration is nearing ~25%. We believe this will continue to grow over the next 
few years as consumers move their preference away from traditional retail formats.  

We believe modern retail will play an important role in FMCG growth over the next 
decade. Modern retail has a ~7% share of the overall FMCG sector in India, according 
to Booz and Co. As penetration of modern retail continues to grow over the next 
decade, we see the share of modern retail growing to 20% by 2020F. Note that the 
share of modern retail in urban India is already close to 25%. This will also keep 
increasing as consumers move their preference to modern retail over the next decade 
or so. In other words, this means modern retail will have a significant influence on the 
pace of growth for the Indian FMCG industry over the next decade.  

F&B segment to lead the way 
The food sector accounted for ~37% of India’s total FMCG market in 2010, according 
to AC Nielsen. We believe over the next decade, this is likely to grow to ~46% as food 
categories outgrow the HPC ones. We believe modern retail will play an important role 
in this growth.  

Currently, the share of modern retail in the F&B space is very low at 2%, but has 
grown an average 55% pa over the last few years, according to AC Nielsen. While we 
believe this level of growth is unlikely to be sustainable, a 30% CAGR over the next 
decade is possible as we believe F&B will continue to account for largest part of a 
consumer’s expense. This is also supported by retail companies’ strategy of increasing 
their exposure to the food space. We estimate that over the next 10 years, of the total 
incremental growth in the food category, 10% or so will be supported only by modern 
retail. We estimate that penetration of modern retail in the F&B space is likely to touch 
8% over the next 10 years.

Recent interaction with stakeholders in the FMCG industry suggests that Indian FMCG 
companies are also aware of this phenomenon and are very inclined to do business 
via modern retail outlets. FMCG companies are keen to ensure their products are 
available through modern retail channels, which enable them to target the urban 
population with more disposable income. They are looking to give ‘sweeter’ deals to 
modern trades over general trades in urban areas, as the target audience can be

reached better via the modern retail format. This is especially true for products such as 
processed foods, where the target audience is shopping at modern retail outlets than 
at traditional retail outlets. 

Consumer wallet still dominated by Food & Beverage 
Despite the growing importance of other categories such as clothing, footwear, 
accessories, jewellery, etc, the share of food and beverages continues to dominate the 
share of a consumer wallet. According to Images India Retail, the retail F&B share is 
still ~60%, which means it remains the most important part of the overall retail trade. 
While this part of the trade has been dominated by traditional retail over the years, 
recent growth of modern retail has meant that the share of modern retail has improved. 
However, there is still a long way to go before modern retail accounts for a sizeable 
proportion of overall retail trade, especially in the F&B space.

Private labels – a modern retail phenomenon 
As modern retail started to grow in India, private labels started to make an entry into 
the FMCG market. The steady rise of private labels has been a consistent 
phenomenon across the globe now. Globally, private label market penetration as a 
percentage of retailers’ overall sales is significant: the global average is ~17, Europe: 
23% and US: 16%. Emerging markets, however, are still behind in terms of private 
label penetration, at ~6%. In India, the overall share of private labels within organised 
retail is ~5%, which makes it one of the lowest in the world (Images India Retail 2009).  

However, therein lies an opportunity for Indian retailers, with retailers increasingly 
realising that private labels can be a significant success if the product offering presents 
value to the consumer. This is especially true for a country like India where consumers’ 
perception of ‘value’ is extremely important.

Private labels are shelf led brands 

Private labels are a phenomenon of modern retail and are, hence shelf led brands, for 
which the advertising happens in terms of shelf placement as against manufacturer 
brands which are adverting led, on TV, print, etc. This is a key differentiator in terms of 
costs, where private labels seem to have a distinct advantage over manufacturer 
brands. Manufacturer advertising may lead the consumer to the category or the 
product but at the point of sale, consumer may prefer to go with private label brands 
over manufacturers’ brands.

F&B category dominates 

Within the private label space, most retailers have a large percentage share of the 
category in F&B. We estimate F&B has on average a 30-35% share of private labels 
across retailers. This is the segment which we believe the retailers have also 
recognised is the best opportunity in FMCG and have been growing aggressively over

the last few years. Categories such as pasta, instant noodles, other processed foods, 
packaged staples are the segments where retailers are concentrating their efforts in. 

Private label success has led to category expansion 

Private labels have started in India at a much earlier phase in the development of 
modern retail. However, in developed countries, private labels only came into being 
once the category penetration was nearly saturated. The role of private label in those 
countries was to provide consumers with a lower price point for a comparable product.  

In India, the penetration levels across categories are still low and the role of modern 
retail is largely to drive the category penetration. Private labels have been instrumental 
in leading category growth in several FMCG segments. By category growth, we mean 
an inclusive growth consisting of both increased penetration and per capita 
consumption.  

The recent success of categories such as breakfast cereals (corn flakes, oats, muesli, 
etc) has been helped by the entry of private labels, which helped push products to 
many more new consumers than before.  

Private labels brands cheaper but not inferior in quality 

There is a perception among consumers that private labels are cheaper compared to 
established brands because the quality of goods is much lower. However, in our 
interaction with Pantaloon Retail India, the company pointed out that its private label 
brand premium harvest, which is the umbrella brand for packaged staples, is cheaper 
than established brands only because its costs are lower and there are no significant 
quality differentiations.  

Exhibit 54. Premium Harvest staples in Big Bazaar

Private labels enhance bargaining power for modern retail …  

As the costs of having private label brands in the store are much lower, there is more 
leverage for retailers stocking private label brands in terms of profitability. Retailers’ 
shelf space is sought after by FMCG companies, and the presence of private labels 
gives retailers the bargaining power to negotiate better terms with manufacturers. 
Some of this benefit may be passed on to the consumer, which will also help in driving 
category sales, in our view.

… but not a threat to established brands 

Although private labels are growing strongly, the share of organised retail under 10% 
means they are not a threat to established brands. Moreover, the primary role of 
private labels is to drive category growth and because the market for many categories 
is growing, private brands, in our view, are not a threat to established brands.  

Modern retail to help convert non-users to users 

One of the opportunities across FMCG is to convert non users to come into the 
categories, even at the lowest part of the value chain. This has the potential to 
significantly shift the growth trajectory across categories upwards, as there is still a 
large majority of consumers in India who are non users of many of the products across 
the FMCG industry. This is especially true for the food category, where the penetration 
level in many categories is still very low compared to HPC’s, in which some of the 
categories are close to being optimally penetrated. Modern retail has taken the lead in 
this regard across the FMCG categories by luring more and more consumers into the 
category by way of different promotions and strategies.  

In several categories such as oats and instant noodles, modern retailers have 
launched their private label brands which are expected to grow significantly. This has 
aided the growth rates of the categories. 

India remains a huge unbranded market and therein lies an opportunity for retailers. 
Future FMCG group is looking at opportunities across categories, which include 
cosmetics, for which the value of brands is seen as key to success. However, in that 
sense, we see India as a distinctive market which provides an opportunity to migrate 
non users into the category. This is where modern retail has a big advantage over 
established brands in luring consumers.  

Converting non-users to users 
will be a big opportunity

Modern Retail’s role in developing the supply chain 

The importance of supply chain in the development of modern retail cannot be 
stressed more. Having an efficient supply chain system will not only ensure that 
product availability is enhanced, but also helps in putting controls in place on costs.  

One of the key concerns for the FMCG industry has been the low fill rates that are 
prevalent in the country. The fill rate is defined at the percentage of time that the 
product which the consumer is willing to buy is actually available in the store. 
According to Images India Retail 2009, the industry average fill rate is close to 65-70%, 
which means about 30% of the time, the consumer is not able to find the product that 
he/she is looking for. This is direct cost to the retailer and the manufacturer, as non 
availability of the product leads to loss of revenues. 

Modern retail has invested heavily behind developing an efficient supply chain. One of 
the benefits of having an efficient supply chain is that many of the inefficiencies in the 
form of additional costs get taken out of the system. This would result in cost to the 
consumer coming down, which also leads to improved consumer off take and an 
increase in per capita consumption. 

This is especially relevant given the recent sharp rise in food prices, a result of 
inefficiencies in the supply chain. Many of this relates to traditional retail including 
wholesalers, local retailers, etc. The recent presentation from Bharti Wal-Mart cash 
and carry business suggests that with direct procurement, proper storage and 
distribution, prices can be kept under control.

Food in the global context 

Global food industry 

Global food opportunity is evolving 

Global food opportunity is constantly evolving as a result of changing lifestyles and 
preference for more convenience and variety. Global processed food opportunity is 
valued at €2.5tn, of which the US, Europe and Japan combined account for 60%, 
according to a FICCI report. In that context, the share of the rest of the world (ROW) is 
quite small, but the opportunity size is much larger.

However consumer preferences across regions different 

Consumers are increasingly demanding more customised products across the world. 
However, since consumer development and processed food market development is at 
a different stage across the world, the categories which are most attractive across the 
region are also different. According to a recent survey by AC Nielsen, the global trend 
in food choice across regions throws up some interesting results. 

What the results indicate is that within the processed food segment, consumer 
preferences are different across regions. In mature markets such as the US and 
Europe, consumers are looking at products such as drinkable yogurt, fruit bars, etc, 
while in emerging markets consumers are looking at categories such as juice drinks, 
noodles/pasta and cheese.

Food inflation to be a global concern  

We expect the global food demand-supply condition to undergo a significant change, 
leading to a surge in global food inflation. To quote from our economists Rob 
Subbaraman’s report (The coming surge in food prices, 8 September, 2010):  

The surge in commodity prices in 2003-08 was the largest, longest and most broad-
based of any commodity boom since 1900. The prices of energy and metals surged 
the most, but it was the agricultural market that saw the most fundamental change. It

may not take much of a disruption in food supply to trigger another surge in prices 
given that the dynamics have become a whole lot more uncertain as a result of new 
and some increasingly powerful influences acting on both sides of the food supply-
demand equation. 

We expect another multi-year food price rise, partly because of burgeoning demand 
from the world’s rapidly developing – and most populated – economies, where diets 
are changing towards a higher calorie intake. We believe that most models 
significantly underestimate future food demand as they fail to take into account the 
wide income inequality in developing economies. 

India to follow global trends 

We would also point out that preferences for processed foods also reflect the stage of 
development in the country’s demand for processed food. For instance, in developed 
markets the preferences are for more premium products such as niche dairy drinks, 
drinkable yogurt, etc., while in emerging countries, which are just seeing growth in the 
processed food segment, categories such as juice and noodles are the most popular 
ones. We believe India will follow the global trend and over the next decade some of 
the categories which will grow the fastest are breakfast cereals, baby food, juices etc., 
all of which have reached saturation in developed markets.  

The China example 

We have briefly looked at the history of growth in the packaged food category in China 
to see how growth may pan out in India.  

In 2008, the packaged food industry in China was US$111bn, with a CAGR of 11.5% 
over 2003-08, attributable to a few key factors: 

  Strong GDP growth: Strong real GDP growth rates in China (a 10.8% CAGR over 
2003-08) have led to rapid growth of the Chinese middle class (source: McKinsey). 
The middle class in China is commonly defined as comprising households with an 
annual income of between US$7,500 and US$70,000. This led to a sharp increase 
in spending on processed foods, although the total share of F&B in total household 
income reduced as increase in income was also beneficial for other consumer-
related categories.  

  Urbanisation plays a big role: China‘s population has also become increasingly 
urbanized over the last two decades. In 1990, 27.4% of China‘s population were 
living in urban areas and by 2005, this increased to 40.4% (source: McKinsey). This 
trend is projected by McKinsey to continue, and, by 2015, it is expected that about 
half (49.2%) of China‘s population will be living in an urban centre. As a 
consequence, we believe there will be an increase in the demand for packaged 
foods as seen over the last one decade.  

  Modern Retail drives growth: Growth in the last few years has been driven by 
changes in the retail landscape. The rising role of modern retail formats such as 
supermarkets, convenience stores and hypermarkets also has a big impact on the 
type of food consumers are buying. Buying patterns have shifted from staples to 
processed foods. 

We believe India is also on the cusp of a consistent period of strong growth over the 
next decade. If India follows in the footsteps of China, we believe India in the next 
decade is going to see a strong development of the processed food category. GDP 
growth is expected to be strong, urbanisation trends are evident and modern retail is 
growing strongly in India, all factors which have helped modern retail in China to grow 
over the past few years.

Valuations food versus HPC 

Valuations reflects higher growth 
In the consumer space, we prefer food companies over the HPC names as food 
companies offer more attractive longer-term opportunities. This also partly gets 
reflected in valuations as food companies trade at a 15% P/E premium to the HPC 
names in India. However, we highlight:  

  In the near to medium term, HPC names are likely to face intense margin pressure 
and thus earnings are at risk with downward bias. Thus the multiples (which have 
corrected partly in the past few months) may be higher than they appear now. 
Hence, the actual premium of food names is significantly lower. 

  We believe that food companies offer an attractive long-term opportunity which is 
unlikely to be held back due to issues like competition, commodity cycles and lack 
of pricing power.  

Hence, we believe that food names should trade at an even greater premium. Jubilant 
Foodworks and GSK Consumer are our picks in the sector.

The company has been looking to aggressively grow its food business over the past 
few years. Saffola Arise, which has a lower glycemic index than regular rice, has been 
launched on the health and wellness platform and has a marked differentiation 
compared with other varieties of rice. It uses short grain rice, which is more popular in 
the south and west and less so in the north and east, where traditionally people prefer 
long grain rice, according to the company. Also more people in the north prefer to have 
basmati rice, which compared with other varieties has a higher glycemic index and a 
much better aroma and flavour (an important factor for consumers in the north, in our 
view). The company is now looking to get a long grain variety of rice, with a lower 
glycemic index to improve its performance in north India. The packaged rice market is 
currently worth Rs4.5bn and has grown at ~25% pa over the past two years. However, 
this market size is based only on consumer pack sizes of 1, 2 and 5kgs. There are 
much bigger pack sizes available and have not been considered in estimating the size 
of the market (source: company data). 

Saffola Oats 

The latest launch in the food segment is Saffola Oats, which has had an encouraging 
start. The company attributes this to: 

  Nascent stage of market: Growth in the breakfast cereals market is at a nascent 
stage in India. This means in the initial years, it will see strong growth with newer 
players entering to establish brands in the category. The total breakfast cereals 
market is worth close to Rs5bn, of which the oats market is worth ~Rs1.35bn 
(source: company data).  

  Easier to change food habits at breakfast: While changing consumer eating 

habits is tough, consumers are more willing to try out new breakfast foods. Oats is 
an urban-centric market. The target audience is an urban household willing to try 
new breakfast foods that offer more convenience and compared to traditional 
breakfast options, oats score better in this aspect. 

Reasons for entry into foods segment 

  Strong Saffola brand: The company always has the advantage of having strong 
brand equity through its edible oil brand Saffola. The brand’s focus on health and 
wellness and ‘good for heart’ is something which Marico could leverage for its foray 
into a new category. In that sense, food is one of the best segments to enter as it 
ties in well with what the company already has.  

Processed food segment one of the most attractive: Marico believes the processed 
food segment will be one of the most attractive segments across Indian FMCG over 
the next few years. This is also borne out by the fact that it has been one of the top

three fastest growing segments over the past few years, according to AC Nielsen. This 
segment presents a huge opportunity as market growth is expected to remain strong in 
the medium term, meaning the opportunity size is going to get bigger over time.  

  Margins comparable: In terms of margin profile, the foods business operates on a 
much lower gross margin compared with segments such as HPC. However, A&P 
spending in the segment is also much lower, meaning the EBITDA margins are 
almost comparable (source: company data). The point on A&P spending being 
much lower is established by the fact that more than 70% of the A&P is spent on 
HPC products by FMCG companies. This also means the ROCE matrix is attractive 
from a longer-term perspective.  

  Higher success rate: Another important factor is that the success rate of new 
product launches is much higher in the food category compared with HPC, 
suggesting lower spending needed to move consumers towards the new product.   

Key challenges in the food segment 

  Taste – most important determinant: Marico’s experience with Saffola Zest 
indicates that taste is the most important determinant of success and product 
acceptability. With Saffola Zest, the company tried to put health and wellness 
benefits higher than the taste benefits, which led to moderate success for the 
product. This is a key lesson for the company, and something it will incorporate into 
future product launches, according to the company. 

  Regional biases important: One of the key challenges in the food segment is that 
regional biases play a very important role in the success of the product. With tastes 
and preferences changing every few hundred kilometres in India, the probability of 
one homogeneous product being able to succeed across the country is less likely 
than in most other countries in the world. This is a challenge, which is almost 
unique to the Indian market.  

  Supply chain issues: In the food category, supply chain issues are more complex 
as it depends on the kind of product a company is looking to launch, For instance, a 
health and wellness product such as Saffola Zest only needs to be available in 
modern retail outlets and bigger traditional retail outlets. However, a snack item 
launched at lower price points such as Lays, by PepsiCo, needs wider availability 
across Kirana stores, small retail outlets and across the country. Hence the 
distribution channel required will be much wider and deeper compared with a niche 
product such as Saffola Zest. This is an example of how two products within the 
same category of ‘snacking’ requires different investment strategies in supply chain 
and distribution.  

  Shelf life shorter compared with HPC: Another important consideration for 

products in the food space is that the shelf life is much shorter compared with HPC 
products. This means that distribution and storage requirements are vastly different. 
Products in the food segment have a shelf life from about seven days to three 
months, while in the HPC space the range is much broader, from about three 
months to three years.  

Pantaloon on the food business 

Key reasons for entry into food business 

  Initial strategy was not food led: Pantaloon’s initial strategy was not led by the 

food category as the thought was that consumers would not be willing to pay more 
for the convenience offered. Hence, Pantaloon started off as a fashion and general 
merchandise retailer. This anomaly of consumers not wanting to pay for 
convenience at a convenience store meant the food strategy came much later 
compared with the fashion and general merchandise.

  Change in consumer behaviour pattern: Once the consumers came on board for 
the fashion and general merchandise, there was a realisation that modern retail 
offering food and fresh would be something the company was willing to experiment 
with. Consumers were also willing to pay for this additional service, if the value 
delivered was more than the cost incurred.  

  Modern trade key to FMCG companies: Although modern trade accounts for only 

6-7% of total sales for FMCG companies per Images India Retail 2009, the 
importance cannot be over emphasised. This is especially true for premium 
products and products, which are more relevant for consumers in the urban areas. 
Modern retail’s share in urban areas is close to 25%, which is a significant share 
and is growing fast, as retailers continue to expand (source: CII FMCG forum). 

  FMCG companies inclined to modern trade: FMCG companies are keen to 

ensure their products are available through the modern retail channels (source: CII 
FMCG Forum). They are looking to give ‘sweeter’ deals to the modern retail 
channels vs the traditional retail channels in urban areas, as the target audience 
can be reached better via modern retail. This is especially true for products such as 
processed foods, where the target audience is shopping at modern retail outlets vs 
traditional retail outlets. 

Challenges in fresh business 

  Increasing the range: One of the most important challenges in the food category 

is to provide the consumers with a large number of options or varieties in 
categories. For instance, providing consumers with six varieties of potato or tomato, 
and getting to upgrade them to pay more for a particular variety of basic food item. 
While this may seem simple, the value that can be derived from this strategy is one 
of the most attractive across the food sector in India, according to Pantaloon.  

  Supply chain important: Pantaloon has stressed the importance of having a good 
supply chain, and has invested significantly in this. Future Logistics, the group 
company, has played a role in executing its back-end systems across the formats. 
However, the market is of the opinion that the supply chain is key to driving retail 
sales, which seems to be overplayed. The ‘low hanging fruit’ is in driving 
consumers to pay more for the basic varieties of fresh and groceries, according to 
Pantaloon.  

  Loose staples: Stores across the Indian retail space still sell staples loose, where 
the consumer can come in, feel the variety of staples and get them packed before 
buying. This behaviour has more to do with the thought that touching and feeling 
staples would enable one to differentiate the quality of various staples, although 
according to Pantaloon, only a minority of the consumers can tell the difference. 
While this may seem not much of a concern for retailers, the cost of selling loose 
staples packed in the store is ~2.5% higher than the same variety of staples 
packed at the warehouse, according to Pantaloon. This is because the packaging 
happens at store rentals rather than at warehouse rentals, so the consumer is 
waiting for the packaging to be done and the dedicated resource will only spend 
time packing the material intermittently vs doing the job full time at a warehouse, 
which means his productivity is much lower in the store. However, this is a 
challenge that retailers will continue to face until consumer behaviour changes. 

  Time spent may not be a concern: The common opinion that consumers who 
come to the modern retail outlets are pressed for time may not be the case. A 
consumer may need to drive 20-30 minutes to go to a mall and, hence may expect 
the modern retail stores to provide more options compared to the traditional retails 
formats. By keeping the consumer engaged, it provides an opportunity to drive per 
footfall sales or ticket sizes. 

  Foods in private label space: In developed markets, where the concept of brand 
is much more entrenched among consumers, private labels are seen as the poor

man’s brand. This is true in all categories, but it is especially true for food, where 
the value of a trusted brand is much more than in the HPC space, according to 
Pantaloon. However, in India, this is not the case. Private labels in the food space 
have been actively looking for innovations and in some case, have also led the 
innovation strategy in the category. The launch of ketchup in 1kg pouches comes 
from Future Group’s private label brand, and other branded manufacturers soon 
followed the move. This innovation made a big change in the value of the category 
by taking about Rs30 off the value chain in terms of costs related to packaging, 
transport etc, and allowed new consumers to come into the category at a lower 
point of entry. This trend could continue as retailers are now very close to the 
consumer at the point of sales and may have a better insight into what are being 
demanded compared with manufacturers. 

  Private labels are shelf-led brands: Private labels are a phenomenon of modern 

retail and, hence are shelf-led brands, where advertising is in terms of shelf 
placement compared with manufacturer brands that are advertising-led, on TV, 
print, etc. This is a key differentiator in terms of costs, where private labels seem to 
have a distinct advantage compared to manufacturer brands. Manufacturer 
advertising may lead the consumer to the category or the product but at the point of 
sale, the consumer may prefer to go with private label brands.  

  Non-users are the biggest opportunity: One of the biggest opportunities across 
FMCG is to convert non-users to come into the categories, even at the lowest part 
of the value chain. This has the potential to significantly shift the growth trajectory 
across categories upwards, as there is still a large majority of consumers in India 
who are non-users of many products across the FMCG industry. According to 
Pantaloon, this is especially true for food; the penetration levels in many food 
categories are still very low compared with HPC (some of HPC categories are close 
to being optimally penetrated). At this stage of consumer evolution, the company 
sees this as an opportunity for all the players in the category, and market shares 
etc will become more relevant once these categories are optimally penetrated.  

  Private labels opportunity in other categories: India remains a huge unbranded 
market and therein lies the opportunity for retailers to capitalise. The part of the 
market that is brand conscious is also always looking for value, and is willing to 
look at other brands if the value proposition is good. Future Group is looking at 
opportunities across categories, which include cosmetics, where the value of 
brands is seen as key to success, according to Pantaloon. However, in that sense 
India is a unique market where there is an opportunity to migrate non-users (a large 
percentage of population are non-users) into the category.  

  Consumer buying patterns difficult to gauge: One of the most difficult things to 
gauge in modern retail is changing consumer behaviour. For example, a family of 
four would want to buy packs of 10 Pears soaps, 6kgs of Surf, 10kgs of potatoes, 
three large packs of toilet cleaners, etc. However in India, such buying patterns are 
influenced by many other factors, such as buying in bulk with a view to giving a 
portion to family members, elderly neighbours etc, which are difficult to explain 
purely from a consumption perspective.  

  Modern retail exists to facilitate consumption: The role of modern retail is to 
facilitate consumption and not be concerned too much by consumer buying 
behaviour. At this stage of modern retail evolution, the real opportunity lies behind 
increasing consumption and not be overly concerned explanations behind these 
buying patterns. 

  Processed foods a big opportunity: Processed food will be a very attractive 

opportunity over the coming years, per Pantaloon, helped by a variety of factors 
including increasing urbanisation, rising consumer incomes, and preference for 
convenience foods among a growing percentage of the population. However, 
growth in this category is going to be secondary to the potential growth in trading 

Nomura

consumers up (ie, getting consumers to buy more premium stuff within the same 
category) in basic categories such as staples and fresh (eg, moving people to buy 
organic vegetables). This is largely because the share of modern retail in the 
overall retail market is still under 10% and grocery and staples still account for 
about 60% of the consumer basket spending, according to Pantaloon.  

  Breakfast cereals maybe first category to grow big: Following feedbacks from a 
number of players in the category, one of the categories which may be the first to 
see a breakthrough is breakfast cereals, as consumers are more willing to try new 
breakfast items. Indeed, many leading consumer companies in India have launched 
breakfast cereals in the past few years, with a view to gaining a first-mover 
advantage. Private labels are also active in this segment, and retailers have 
launched variants similar to branded players across the portfolio which may help 
move new consumers into the category. However, the opportunity size still remains 
very attractive. Nestlé has yet to enter the category, and the company recently said 
it would leverage its parent company’s portfolio to launch products in India in the 
near term. Local companies such as Marico have also launched products into this 
category and competition in this category is expected to be tough in the coming 
years, according to Pantaloon, although growth in the category itself is likely to be 
very attractive. Most players currently are only concerned about growing the 
category, focusing on share only when the category has expanded, according to 
Pantaloon. 

  Innovation: There has been a lot of focus on innovation in the last few years. 

While innovation is going to be the key driver, according to Pantaloon, execution is 
not an easy task in a heterogeneous market like India. Consumer taste and 
preferences change every few miles in India and, hence one product serves all 
strategy (one product to meet the needs of all consumers) does not work in India. 
This is true across all the categories and this will be the key challenge in India. In 
this context, modern retail, being closer to the consumer in terms of point of sale, 
may have an advantage over manufacturers. For instance Future Group sells Chitle 
Bandhu Bhakarwadi (local snack) in one of its stores in Bangalore and Govindbhog 
rice in a Big Bazaar store in Delhi. This has driven sales at the store from a 
particular community, as people come to the store for the product and buy other 
goods from the store at the same time.  

  Innovation needs an Indian touch: Innovation in food needs an “Indian touch” to 
be successful, which could be in any form to connect better with the consumer. 
This is one area that could offer bigger opportunity for retailers than for FMCG 
manufacturers. Future Group, through its Big Bazaar stores, has been offering idly 
and dosa batter, which is very popular with consumers from north India, according 
to Pantaloon. Retailers also have better opportunities than FMCG manufactures to 
target consumers for specific events such as festivals. For instance in 3Q CY10, a 
couple of stores in Bangalore located closed to each other offered specific products 
tailored to consumers celebrating Eid and Diwali. A differentiated product offering 
such as this is more difficult for FMCG companies to manage. 

  MNC houses looking to standardise: FMCG companies tend to look to 

standardize a product offering across a country, but this strategy does not work well 
in India, where consumer choices are heterogeneous. Standardisation, attractive 
from a company perspective as it improves ROI, will be difficult to yield good results 
in India. While Maggi Noodles, Pepsi and Coca-Cola have been successful, many 
others face a daunting task of winning consumers using a standardised product. 
For example, Horlicks (more popular in south India even years after its launch) and 
Saffola Arise (more popular in the south than in the north). There is also evidence 
of companies having succeeded in their product strategy when they have looked to 
customize as against standardize their product offering. HUL and Tata Tea have 
different varieties of tea sold in different parts of the country under the same brand 
name, and have recorded big success.

KFC on the India opportunity 

Exhibit 60. KFC India customised menu 

Source: Company 

 `

We had a meeting with Mr Hezal Ahmed, the CEO of QSR brands in Maharashtra (12 
December, 2010). The two private companies under which these restaurants are 
managed are Mumbai Chicken Private Limited and Pune Chicken Restaurants Private 
Limited. QSR brands now have the right of first refusal to grow the KFC brands 
franchise in Maharashtra. Feedback from the meeting: 

  Robust plans to grow KFC restaurants business: The company has robust 

plans to grow the KFC business in Maharashtra. Currently, the company has three 
stores operating in Mumbai and one in Pune and it plans to move this to ~30 stores 
by FY12. This will mean significantly improving penetration of the KFC restaurants 
in the state, which should help drive higher footfalls and sales over the next few 
years.  

  Low penetration: According to the company, the KFC restaurants per 100 people 

has shown significant under penetration even in metro areas such as Mumbai when 
compared with markets such a Malaysia, Singapore etc. Malaysia’s population is 
close to 27mn and the number of KFC restaurants in the country is close to 550. In 
India, even if we consider only 10% of the entire population as a target audience, 
there would be close to 100mn people and there are 89 KFC restaurants in India. In 
Maharashtra, the numbers are equally underpenetrated. 

  Competition: Management believes competition is mainly from McDonalds in India, 
as both restaurants have many similarities. Dominos, Pizza Hut and Subway, while 
all being part of the overall category of QSR, are different in terms of product and 
model of delivery. The company, which considers its product offering unique, is 
confident of driving the market for fried chicken in the longer term.  

  Pricing: The company is cautious about following the path of price cuts to attract 

customers. It expects to maintain pricing at a premium to McDonald’s and expects 
its average consumer invoice to be higher than that of McDonald’s, given the 
premium pricing and the menu which is skewed more towards premium products.  

  Adaptation of menu: The company recognizes the need to change recipes, even 

its flagship product (KFC fried chicken) so that it suits the tastes of the local 
consumers. It has already taken steps to change the taste of its products, like 
making the fried chicken spicier than it is in other countries. It also has a full 
vegetarian menu with items such as vegetarian zinger burger and pulao. 

  Realty costs locked in: The company acknowledges that there has been a rise in 
realty costs, but said the leases are all long-term leases with escalation clauses 
already built in. As such, it is able to plan for the longer term, keeping in mind the 
cost dynamics as far as lease expenses are concerned.  

  Personnel expenses: The company has been hiring across the various levels as it 
builds out the stores. Availability of trained personnel is in short supply in the retail 
sector in India. However, the company is now investing in training and investing in 
career growth and development of the employees, which it hopes will encourage 

Nomura

more loyalty towards employers with employees taking a longer term view of their 
prospects.  

  Consumer sentiment: The company pointed to a key difference between pizza 

restaurants and its restaurants. The basic ingredients in a pizza is vegetarian, with 
the optionality of non-vegetarian toppings making it more acceptable as against the 
fried chicken that KFC sells. In a country where consumers are more skewed 
towards vegetarian food, it is easier to market the idea of a pizza than fried chicken. 
This is the reason why pizza as a category has taken off since the entry of 
international brands in the late 1990s, while success of the KFC restaurants has 
been relatively subdued.  

  Delivery option: Pizza also has the delivery option attached to it, which adds 

convenience to a product which is already more accepted among the consumers. 
Also home delivery within 30 minutes of a pizza ensures very small difference in 
the product between home delivery and eating out. This is clearly not the case for a 
product like fried chicken, which has to be served hot in the restaurant.  

  Plans to get other brand owned by Yum!: Yum! Brands owns six restaurant 
brands including KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers and Pizza Hut 
Delivery. While the opportunity to get other brands such as Taco Bell into India 
remains, the company is only looking to grow the KFC brand in Maharashtra (only 
place it has a licence to grow from Yum Brands! International). It mentioned that the 
focus would only be on growing the KFC franchise, with other options to be looked 
at a later time, once it has established a strong base of KFC restaurants in 
Maharashtra.  

  Sourcing of poultry: The company sources poultry from Venky’s, which is listed in 
India. The company has locked in longer-term supply contracts, which ensure a 
stable supply at prices which are reasonable for both the buyer and seller. The 
relationship with KFC restaurants will also mean strong growth opportunities for 
Venky’s considering the growth path KFC restaurants are on per company.  

  Store levels economics: The company imports about 90% of the in-store 

equipment requirements from outside India. Considering the import duty the cost of 
setting up a store is high, which in turn means the breakeven period is longer than 
in some other countries. Investment cost per store is close to US$300-400k. 
However, this is helped by revenue per store being higher than the average in 
Malaysia. The average store revenues are in the range of RM440,000, which is 
almost double the Malaysian average and is also more than the average in 
Singapore per company.

ITC on the food category 

Exhibit 61. ITC foods product portfolio 

Source: Company 

  Competition in the food category to increase: Foods remains one of the best 
opportunities across consumer space over the next few years, according to ITC. 
However, this will also mean the competition is going to be tough, with many new 
entrants coming into the category.  

  Input costs a concern: Input cost prices for food will continue to remain volatile, 

but the longer-term trend is certainly moving higher. Current thinking in the industry 
is how to handle the volatility, but longer term the concern is how the handle the 
structural input cost inflation. Nestlé, a market leader in many of the food segments, 
recently echoed the same thing (according to the company 3Q FY10 presentation) 
and some companies realize the importance of the longer-term structural increase 
in food prices. This is on account of dwindling food supplies worldwide with 
increasing urbanization.  

  Modern trade key to success: Growth of modern trade will be one of the key 

factors for success of the FMCG industry over the next few years. This is especially 
true for the urban areas, where penetration of modern trade is much faster. Modern 
trade will have to be seen as part of the ‘delivery process’ which starts with 
conceptualizing a product to actual delivery to the consumer. Modern trade 
profitability is low, but going forward as it becomes more important to the delivery 
process, profitability will also grow.

  Cycles getting smaller: Trends in the FMCG sector will probably move much 

faster than many other sectors. This will mean product cycles getting much shorter 
and companies having to constantly evolve their products to suit changing 
consumer needs and preferences.  

  Change in consumer demand: As India’s income has increased over the past 

two-three decades, the needs of the consumer in relation to FMCG products have 
also undergone a change. In the 1970s the Indian consumer was largely looking for 
basic food, and this meant the focus was only on staples grocery. In the 1980s and 
1990s with incomes moving up, the consumer started to look at other options which 
offered him/her convenience along with value for money. This was the period for 
products such as instant noodles, which have today become a large segment on 
their own. Since 2000, the focus has further shifted to ready to eat products and the 
trend towards premiumisation. This is likely to continue over the medium term, as 
growing urbanisation means the consumer has less time to devote to cooking. The 
challenge is to create new categories and develop new options at an affordable 
price to help the consumer make the choice to move up. 

Future value retail on food business 
  Private brands as category champions: One of the key things to consider while 

evaluating private label brands is that their primary aim is to grow the market for the 
product. Most people consider private label brands as something where the 
retailers have to disrupt established brands and help in having better negotiating 
power. While that is important, retailers are looking to grow the category which will 
help drive sales both of branded and private labels in their stores. A large 
supermarket in an area can help push up sales by 15% and in some categories by 
even 35% per company.  

  India is a huge unbranded opportunity: India remains a huge unbranded 

opportunity across the FMCG space and this is a gap that private label can help fill 
over the longer term and help move consumers from unbranded to local branded 
private labels. Consumers can then at some point move to branded products 
certainly in some categories. Modern retail thus has strong power to be the game 
changer over the longer term. 

  Private labels can be fast and nimble: Since private label brands do not invest in 
R&D, they can be much faster and nimble in understanding consumer needs and 
preferences. With many categories only just starting to emerge in India, this will be 
a key differentiating factor for retailers over the next few years per company.  

Bharti Wal-Mart on cash and carry business 
  Bharti Wal-Mart cash and carry business in India: The company has five stores, 

one each in Amritsar, Zirakpur, Jalandar, Kota and Bhopal (a new store just 
launched). The average store size is 3.5-5.0 acres, which gives customers ample 
parking space and makes it easier for them to transport goods back to their 
warehouses. The company plans to have about 15 stores in operation by 2011 in 
India. The stores offer a wide variety of products, which are relevant to the 
consumers in the local area at transparent and low prices on a consistent basis. 
Most importantly, at these stores, the fill rates are close to 90-95%, which is one of 
the main differences between the growth trajectories that a retail outlet could see.  

  Regulation a concern: Modern retail still makes up only less than 10% of the 

overall retail business in India. One of the main reasons is that regulation does not 
allow 100% FDI in multi-brand retail at this time. Regulation, however, allows 100% 
FDI in cash and carry business, which has some basic criteria: 

  Goods must be sold to businesses with a valid licence; and 

 

Invoices must be settled on the spot.

  Modern retail share to remain below EMG average: The company estimates the 
share of modern retail, even assuming a 27% sales CAGR over the next six years, 
will be less than 20%. This is because it expects the overall market size to continue 
to grow, and although modern retail is likely to grow faster, it will likely take much 
longer for the modern retail share to inch up towards even other EMG market levels. 

  Mom-and-pop stores dominate: There are about 12mn mom-and-pop stores of 
which about 7mn are kirana (smaller version of mom-and-pop store) stores. 
Although this number of 12mn is likely to trend down, it is likely to remain a major 
part of overall retail trade, as we highlight in our initiation report on India retail. 

  Competition is from local wholesalers: Cash and carry business faces 

competition from local wholesalers who have been in existence for a long period of 
time and have established relationships with businesses in the area. However, with 
modern retail formats providing a host of services and products which these 
traditional wholesalers are not able to offer, this number might dwindle if cash and 
carry business takes root in the economy. However, cash and carry business at this 
stage is very small and is unlikely to be a threat to wholesalers in the near term. 

  Customer profile: In terms of customer profile for the cash and carry business, 
about 60-65% is made up of resellers of smaller wholesalers. This ensures a 
continuous customer base as these smaller wholesalers then sell to local retailers 
and kirana stores. Some 15-20% of the consumers are from the HoReCa category, 
which is defined as hotels, restaurants and cafe, while another 15-20% is offices 
and institutions, according to the company.

Jubilant Foodworks on what’s made it successful  

Exhibit 62. Dominos Pizza menu in India 

Source: Company 

  Why target the food segment: According to the company, the initial idea came 

about from promoters who travelled to the US and saw the Dominos model work in 
the US. There were no such models operating in India at the time (mid 1990s) and 
this was the opportunity that the promoters saw fit to bring to India. There were 
three factors which were considered key determinants for the success of the model. 

  Less time: Increased urbanisation after the opening up of the Indian economy 
post 1991 meant people would have less time for meals. This was a gap which 
could be bridged by the home delivery model, where you did not need to go out 
for a meal, but it would be delivered fresh at home to the consumer. 

  Convenience: The home delivery system offered a convenient way for the 

consumer to get a new product in the convenience of their homes. This was a 
big differentiating factor in the initial success of the products.  

  Vegetarian base: The pizza had a vegetarian base (flour, cheese and 
vegetables). This is key in a market where about 70% of the people are 
vegetarian per the company. The option for non-veggie toppings ensured that 
both target audiences were happy, but the product had a vegetarian base. 

  No competition: Although there were some regional stores (Nirula’s) selling an 
Indian version of pizza, the products had no real competition in the country at 
the time. This allowed the company to establish its products in the minds of the

Foods & Beverages | India

consumer before any real competition came in the form of Pizza Hut and other 
regional stores. 

  Early learning was key: At the start of 2001, the company had about 35 stores in 
the country. It then went on an expansion spree and by the end of the year the 
company had scaled up to 100 stores. This rapid pace of growth came with its 
problems, as not enough research which went into studying the customer profile in 
the areas per the company. This led to the company not being able to handle the 
pace of the growth during the following year.  

The company took great learning from this phase which allowed it to plan its store 
expansion much better over the next few years. This was key to the sustained 
growth which the company has since achieved.  

  Profitability first: Since the time of consolidation in 2001, the company has 
maintained a strict criterion of putting profitability first. Store expansion was 
undertaken with a singular focus on profitability. The company has since put in 
place a payback period criterion for opening new stores. This payback period is 
three years, and any store across all the regions is evaluated using this benchmark. 
Store managers across the regions are asked to adhere to this benchmark and any 
deviation from this plan is evaluated.  

  Supply chain: The company invested in the supply chain early in its growth stage. 
This ensured that the systems were in place to help store managers evaluate 
performance real time. It has four commissaries in the four regions in India, which 
supply materials and other ingredients to the stores in the region.  

  Growth still ahead: There have been some suggestions per the company that the 
optimal number of stores in the country is close to 750, based on demographics, 
urbanisation trends, size of the population and size of the country, which Dominos 
International uses to evaluate store potential in any country. For example, in the UK, 
750 seems to be the optimal number and has remained at that level for the past 
few years per the company. In the US, the optimal number is close to 5,500 per the 
company. However, this evaluation was done a couple of years back and this 
suggests there is now greater potential in India, as per the company. The company 
believes there is at least another 10-12 years of growth ahead in India before the 
product hits saturation levels.  

  Market share game still far away: The company believes the market for QSR 
restaurants will continue to grow in India for the next 10-12 years. The inflexion 
point for eating out and dining in has just started and will continue to be on the 
growth path for many years per the company. Once the rapid growth phase moves 
to a stable growth trajectory, incremental success will likely depend on market 
share gains. However just like the breakfast cereals market in India, that phase still 
seems to be many years away and in the meantime, participants will focus on 
growing the market and not on gaining share per the company.  

  Human resources: The company has placed emphasis on human resources and 
invested in training and development to ensure employees are motivated. It places 
emphasis on providing deserving employees opportunities to grow within the 
company. An example of this is the head of western region who first joined the 
company as a delivery man. The company prides itself on providing such growth 
opportunities for its employees. 

  Sourcing entirely domestic: The company sources all the required raw materials 
locally. This has been a conscious decision compared with the early phase and has 
helped to bring down costs. It also only manufactures dough at its commissaries 
and everything else is outsourced to external trade partners. It believes in expertise 
and the value it can bring, and hence does not feel the need to source those 
materials internally. Also the scale of the company gives good bargaining power 
with suppliers.

  Factors for choosing a store: 

  The key factors: The company has a clear idea of how it chooses a new store. 
The most important determinants are the number of households. For example: 
schools, offices, etc, in the area, income profile of the people in the area, eating 
habits based on the social demographics in the area. These factors determine 
the potential in any area and whether it will be profitable to setup stores in the 
area. While the company will not have exact income details of the people in the 
area, it looks at demographics and spending patterns of a typical population in 
the area to determine the viability of stores. 

  Rentals: Rentals is one of the most important factors for choosing store 

locations, but is used by the company as a plug factor after determining all the 
above factors. While the company admits to seeing a sharp rise in rentals over 
the past few years, store size is much smaller compared to dine-in restaurants, 
which means the rentals are not very high in absolute terms. The company also 
negotiates long-term leases, which helps in having more bargaining power. 
Going forward, the company expects lease rentals to move up, but in a 
manageable manner. It largely has the stores on a fixed rental basis and only 
10% or less of the total stores have a revenue-sharing component built in. This 
creates huge operating leverage as sales increase per the company, which the 
company is confident will flow through to the bottom line over the next couple of 
years.  

  Issues for failure of stores: The company believes there are two major issues 

with a store not performing up to expectations. First is lack of frequency of orders. 
This means that consumers are not ordering it as frequently as expected. This may 
be due to several possible issues such as not being satisfied with the products, 
product being too expensive, not enough variety for their liking, etc. Store 
managers are asked to evaluate these on an ongoing basis and to take remedial 
measures. Some of the remedial measures are to build in more promotions, and to 
have a more customized approach to the area. Second is lack of penetration. This 
happens when not enough consumers are ordering in from the stores. This second 
issue now arises less than the first one, which suggests product acceptance is 
much higher across the country and is positive for the longer term.  

  Indianisation very important: As has been the feedback from various participants 
in the food industry from manufacturers to retailers, “Indianisation” of the menu is 
very important for it to succeed. The company learned this at the very beginning of 
its growth phase, which allowed it to establish firm brand equity in the minds of 
consumers. Consumers want the best of both worlds of having an international 
product with the customisation to support their tastes and preferences. This proved 
to be a winning proposition as the acceptance of the product, often the most 
important challenge in food, was won very quickly. It helped that the product is 
largely vegetarian and in a country where most of the population is vegetarian, this 
was a unique and easy to accept. More than 50% of the product menu is 
vegetarian-only and no beef is sold in any of the stores. There are also stores 
which are purely vegetarian, to support the sentiments of the local population. One 
of such store is in Ahmadabad.  

  SG&A leverage: The company believes as the same store sales growth continues 
to be robust, the operating leverage from SG&A will be very strong and most of it 
will flow through to the bottom line. This is especially true as the ratio of new stores 
compared with overall stores reduces, which means a larger percentage of the total 
are the older more profitable stores. On average the company makes 18% EBITDA 
margins and 8-9% SG&A expenses, meaning margins of 26-27%. It believes there 
is a 5-6% margin movement both way across the store portfolio, which means there 
are some stores which are above that average and some which are below. It aims 

Nomura 

63

Foods & Beverages | India 

Manish Jain

over the next few years to ensure that more of the stores are above this range, 
which will ensure that the overall margin profile at the company level improves.  

  Pricing: The company has been looking to take pricing up by 5% each year across 
its portfolio. This has worked as consumers are aware of the rising food prices and 
are willing to pay more if the product continues to offer value to them. Per the 
company, it will continue to use this as a long-term target, but will have a mix of 
promotions and varied price increases across its portfolio to manage input costs. 

  MSA till 2024: The company’s current master franchise agreement runs until 2024 
after which it has the right of first refusal for another 10 years. The company is 
confident that essentially the agreement will run to perpetuity as the only issue 
could be of execution. To back its claim, the company has been consistently ranked 
as the top-three Dominos franchisee worldwide, per the company, including the top 
franchisee in 2006, 2007 and 2009. Dominos Worldwide does random checks 
across countries and this is based on results from those surveys as well as other 
operating parametres. This augurs well for the company to maintain its long-term 
relationship with Dominos Inc.

 Action  
  With an estimated 61% earnings CAGR over FY10-FY13F, a dominant 65% share 
of the pizza delivery market and an opportunity to bring other international fast food 
brands into India, Jubilant Foodworks (JFL) is, in our view, one of the most 
attractive opportunities related to the consumer food & beverage theme in India. 
We initiate coverage with a BUY and a PT of Rs620, which implies 24% upside.  

 Catalysts 
  We believe operating leverage in the model will mean margins will continue to

 Anchor themes 

JFL is the market leader in the fast-growing Indian pizza market and has a 65% 
share in the home delivery segment. With robust sales and profit growth, helped by 
strong operating leverage, the company should deliver strong FCF CAGR over the 
next few years, in our view, which makes for an attractive long-term story.

FY10 FY11F FY12F FY13F

 Rapid growth  

Jubilant Foodworks (JFL) is the fastest-growing consumer company in 
our coverage universe, and we expect it to deliver a 61% earnings 
CAGR over FY10-FY13F led by strong same-store sales growth and 
rapid expansion. On our estimates, this should translate into FCF 
growth of 98% over the period. 

 Strong brand equity and incumbent advantage 

JFL has a dominant 65% share of the pizza home-delivery market and 
50% share of the overall pizza market in India. With 364 stores in 
India, it is twice the size of its nearest competitor. We believe it will 
continue to lead the pizza market, given the strong emotional connect 
that the Dominos brand enjoys among consumers.  

 Operating leverage to help margin improvement 

We believe that the Dominos model carries a significant amount of 
operating leverage. Margins should improve 110-130bps over the next 
few years, based on our estimates, as SG&A, A&P and rental 
expense growth lags sales growth. 

 Expansion into smaller cities and other fast food brands 
We believe consensus is overly worried about the lack of growth 
drivers over the medium to long term. We believe that the top six 
metros are still fairly underpenetrated and should drive growth 
comfortably for the next six years, beyond which the smaller cities 
should lead growth. The opportunity to bring in another international 
fast food brand could provide an additional boost to JFL. 

 Initiate with a BUY rating and PT of Rs620 

We initiate coverage at BUY and a PT of Rs620, which implies 24% 
upside. With valuations attractive at 22.7x FY13F, which translates 
into a PEG of 0.5x (consumer sector average of 1.2x), we believe the 
current share price offers an attractive entry point.

Drilling down 

Executive summary 
  JFL is the market leader in the fast-growing Indian pizza market, and according to 

the company, its share in the home-delivery segment is 65%. With robust sales and 
profit growth, helped by strong operating leverage, JFL should deliver strong FCF 
CAGR (we estimate 98%) over the next few years, which makes the long-term 
story very attractive, in our view, although short-term valuations appear marginally 
stretched. 

  Continual addition of stores, expansion into tier II and tier III cities and increasing 
penetration in metros will likely aid robust sales growth. Operating leverage in the 
model means margins are set to expand meaningfully over the next few years and 
this should drive improvement in profitability and a strong FCF CAGR, in our view. 

  JFL is likely to benefit from strong growth of the quick service restaurant format in 
India over the next few years, in our view, helped by its market dominance in the 
pizza format. 

  Although the near-term valuation may appear rich, we believe the opportunity size 
must be taken into account when valuing JFL. Our DCF-based valuation of Rs650 
captures the longer-term growth potential. Even on a P/E basis, we have assigned 
the company a multiple of 28x one-year forward earnings to account for our 
expectation of strong growth. Our P/E-based PT of Rs620 implies upside of 24%. 

  We believe one risk to our view could come from a lower-than-expected store count 
addition over the next few years, which in turn, would mean operating leverage may 
not be as meaningful as we expect. However, with the quick service format likely to 
gain popularity rapidly over the next decade as incomes across the Indian middle-
class population rise, we believe JFL will be able to deliver strong growth over the 
medium term. 

Dominant position in a fast-growing market 

JFL has exclusive franchise rights to the globally successful Dominos Pizza brand in 
India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh. It has, over the past decade, established a 
strong presence in the country across tier I and tier II cities and is continuing to lead 
penetration in both existing and newer cities. JFL has a dominant position in the 
market with more than 65% share and should continue to benefit from strong market 
growth over the next decade, in our view.  

Store additions, strong operating leverage should aid 61% EPS 
CAGR over FY10-FY13F 

We believe the company will continue to benefit from growth in the Indian pizza market 
and will deliver strong 41% sales CAGR over FY10-FY13F, in line with the latest five-
year average of 42%. The strong operating leverage of JFL’s current model could help 
increase profitability by more than 250bps over the next two years, which combined 
with the robust sales growth, would mean a 61% EPS CAGR over FY10-FY13F on our 
estimates.  

Strong balance sheet can fund store additions and dividends in 
the next two years 

JFL has no debt on its balance sheet and can fund capex requirements for new stores 
by way of internal accruals. Store expansion and greater penetration could result in 
greater profitability, we believe, which might lead the company to return cash to 
shareholders either by way of dividends or a share buyback, which would be a positive.  

JFL is the market leader with a 
65% share in an under-penetrated 
pizza market

rating and price target of Rs620,

Opportunity to bring other 
international fast food restaurants 
into India 

Jubilant Foodworks 

Manish Jain

Opportunity to bring other international fast food brands to 
India 
Despite the entry of many international quick service restaurant brands into India over 
the past decade, there are many large international brands that still do not have an 
India presence. JFL could look to bring one of these brands into India in the same way 
it brought Dominos Pizza. With its experience of developing a quick service restaurant 
brand in India, we believe this could be a key development over the next year and 
would be a catalyst for the stock. 

Quick service restaurant format: attractive opportunity in India 

We believe quick service restaurants are an attractive opportunity in India over the 
next decade or so, because penetration remains very low vs that in other countries. 
Pizza is one the top two categories within this space, and Dominos is the market 
leader in this segment with more than twice the number of stores vs the second-largest 
player (Pizza Hut).  

Valuation 

We have valued the company using multiple methodologies. Our DCF-based valuation 
of Rs650 gives potential upside of 30%. However, we use a P/E approach to arrive at 
our Rs620 price target, in line with the valuation methodology we use for other 
consumer companies under our coverage. We assign a target multiple of 28x FY13F 
EPS of Rs22. 

The stock trades at a P/E multiple of 34.3x our FY12F EPS of Rs14.5. Current 
valuations might appear rich relative to the sector (at 23.5x). But we believe a story like 
JFL should be looked at in light of the significant growth opportunity over the medium 
term. 

Our average valuation for the consumer companies we cover is 23.5x one-year 
forward earnings, with average earnings growth of 20%, which translates into a PEG of 
1.2x. Over FY10-FY15F, we expect JFL to deliver an earnings CAGR of 45%, so a P/E 
multiple of 28x translates into a PEG multiple of 0.5x, which we consider reasonable 
as compared to the sector. Our P/E multiple-based PT of Rs620 implies 24% upside. 

Risks to our investment view 

Risk to our numbers and estimates could come from the following: 

  Termination of its master franchise agreement with Dominos Inc would be the 

biggest risk, as JFL’s only line of business at present is the exclusive franchise of 
the Dominos Pizza brand in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 

  Sharp rise in input costs could cap improvement in profitability if JFL does not pass 

on the rise in prices to consumers. 

  Lease rentals are an important part of overall costs and a sharp increase in lease 

rentals both for new and old stores could pressure profitability. 

  The company’s longer-term success depends on the acceptability of its product in 
tier II and tier III cities. Slower-than-expected progress in these regions could lead 
to a slowdown in longer-term earnings growth.

Financial analysis 

Strong sales, improving margins and FCF 
  With macro conditions remaining supportive, demographics offering long-term 

attractions and a largely under-penetrated market, we expect JFL to deliver strong 
earnings growth over the next couple of years helped by: 

Expect company to deliver strong 
sales growth and margins 
improvement 

  Robust same-store sales growth (in the mid-teens).  

  Aggressive expansion in key markets. We expect the company to add 65-70 

stores per annum in the medium term.  

  Steady increase in ticket size, as well as frequency of orders per household. 

  We expect margins to improve steadily if:  

 

the company maintains its strong focus on cost savings by streamlining the 
back-end; we believe savings in freight, procurement and logistics would flow 
through to the bottom line. 

  operating leverage keeps flowing into the bottom line. Even mid-teen same-

store sales growth would enable the company to improve profitability 
significantly, based on our estimates.  

  JFL turned FCF positive in FY10, and we expect continuing strong generation of 
FCF as operating leverage should help improve profitability. We also expect the 
company could start paying dividends as early as FY12F.

Margins now at an all-time high… 

From FY05 to FY09, JFL’s operating margins remained in a narrow band of 11-13%, 
as the company continued to invest in expansion and had yet to achieve critical mass. 
However, 2010 marked a breakthrough for the company as far as profitability was 
concerned, with margins expanding suddenly by 350bps to an all-time high of 15.7%

as the benefits of operating leverage kicked in. 9M FY11 also witnessed a further 
margin expansion of 250bps y-y to an average of 18%.  

We believe this has been possible on account of the following: a rapid pick-up in 
same-store sales growth and operating leverage kicking in as costs such as rent, 
logistics, salaries did not grow at the same pace as sales. 

This should also facilitate quicker break-even for new stores, in our view, as the brand-
building efforts over the past few years have enhanced brand recall and customers are 
increasingly more receptive to the cuisine and the menu, based on findings by the 
company.  

Operating margin has seen a 
marked improvement and we 
expect this trend to continue

…should continue to drive profitability higher in coming years 

We believe the operating leverage of JFL’s model will continue to drive profitability 
higher over the next few years. As the company continues to deliver strong sales 
growth, we expect margins to continue to show an improvement over the next few 
years.  

As JFL continues to follow its strategy of saturating existing markets and increasing 
penetration across the top six cities, the benefits of streamlined logistics should mean 
newer stores will turn profitable more quickly, in our view. Also, the company should 
save significant money on advertising, thus enhancing profitability. With penetration in 
top six cities still less than 50%, we believe the room to grow is significant over the 
next five years.  

Furthermore, the company follows a unique business model which ensures that new 
stores turn profitable in the third year: 1) its delivery model ensures that the size of 
each outlet is relatively small compared to other dine-in pizza outlets in India, yielding 
cost savings on décor; 2) the company also saves on rents on account of the smaller 
size of outlets; and 3) given the high brand recall among consumers, little or no extra 
effort is required in driving sales at a new outlet. We believe this helps ensure that 
rapid expansion does not excessively weigh on the company’s profitability.  

As a result, peak margins for the company are still some years away, in our view, and 
over the next few years, we see profitability continuing to rise. Additionally, our bottom-
up single-store model suggests margins should start seeing a sharp rise from year 3 of 
the store opening, which implies that the majority of stores opened before FY09 should 
deliver strong margin performance over the next couple of years. This should also help 
improve margins at the company level, we expect.  

Our discussions with the company suggest some stores are already operating at 23-
24% margins, while others are at 15-16%. We believe over the next couple of years, 
the stores operating at the upper end of this band will rise as a percentage of overall 
stores, which would help improve margins at the company level. We have not built in 
the entire benefit of these levers into our model at this stage and are looking for a 
~110bp improvement in margins in FY12F and 135bp improvement in FY13F.

Strong FCF generation starting FY10 
JFL turned FCF positive in FY10, and with operating leverage flowing through to the 
bottom line over the next few years, we expect FCF generation to continue to gather 
strong momentum. The company generated FCF of Rs164mn in FY10, but this 
number should increase significantly to Rs1,346mn in FY13F, on our estimates. With 
cashflow from operations remaining ahead of guided capex requirements over the next 
few years, we believe FCF generation will be significant.  

Debt repaid post IPO 
JFL had debt of Rs824mn at the end of FY09. For the first few years of its operations, 
JFL used debt capital and some internal accruals to fund new store expansion. 
However, post its IPO in February 2010, the company has repaid this debt. The 
absence of an interest burden adds to the attractiveness of the business in the longer 
term, in our opinion.  

Strong balance sheet supports dividend payout 
As revenue momentum remains robust, margins and FCF improve, JFL’s balance sheet 
will continue to look stronger over the next few years, in our view. Strong FCF generation 
means cash on books will rise significantly over the next few years. We model for cash 
levels to increase from Rs70mn in FY10 to Rs1.3bn in FY12F. To date, the company has 
never paid a dividend, but we believe with FCF generation high and capex requirements 
adequately covered by internal accruals, it could start paying dividends by FY12F.  

Expect strong FCF generation 
over the next couple of years

Valuation higher than sector 
average, but growth opportunity 
much bigger 

Jubilant Foodworks 

Manish Jain

Valuation 

Valuation appears high — not unusual 
The stock trades at a P/E multiple of 22.7x our FY13F EPS of Rs22. While valuations 
appear rich at first glance, we believe a story like JFL should be viewed in terms of the 
opportunity it offers over the medium term. On this basis, we think the valuation is 
justifiable. Our valuation methodology for JFL reflects this thought process. We have 
used multiple valuation methodologies for the stock.  

We used a three-stage DCF-based valuation model with the following key assumptions. 

  Near-term CAGR of 61% (FY10-13F), medium-term CAGR of 20% (FY14-19F) and 

longer-term CAGR of 13% (FY20-25F).  

  Cost of equity at 13% 

  Terminal value at 6% 

Our DCF-based valuation is Rs650, with potential upside of 30% from current levels.  

We believe our medium-term growth rate assumption is justified as over the past few 
years, the company has delivered strong growth. With the market still largely under-
penetrated even in urban areas, we think the company looks poised to deliver average 
20% growth. We expect growth to slow progressively to a more stable 13% over the 
longer term.  

We also looked at what the current market price is factoring in for the medium- to 
longer-term growth trajectory for the company based on the same DCF model. In our 
view, the current market price only factors in a ~14% growth rate over the medium 
term. We believe the market is underestimating the long-term store growth potential 
and the improvement in margins at the current price, and hence, valuation on 
consensus numbers may appear high. We believe margins will improve further on 
account of operating leverage and continued strong revenues. However, consensus 
does not appear to share our view; consensus FY13F earnings estimates are 9% 
lower than ours.  

We have also valued the stock using a P/E methodology. For JFL, we have used a P/E 
multiple of 28x one-year forward earnings. Our P/E multiple-based price target is 
Rs620, with potential upside of 24% from the current levels.  

The assigned multiple is at a 15% premium to that assigned to the consumer sector 
average and 8% premium to the multiple assigned to other food companies in our 
coverage. We believe that the premium multiple is justified as:  

  We believe JFL offers an impressive growth trajectory in the near term and more 

attractive opportunity in the longer term than its peers, given the following:  

  For all the hygiene and personal care (HPC) companies in our coverage, 

profitability will likely remain under pressure on account of rising competition, 
increasing commodity costs and high penetration. Thus, we believe HPC 
companies should trade at a justifiable discount. However, JFL does not face 
steep competition, its input cost pressure is lower due to better sourcing and 
bargaining power with suppliers, and it has greater pricing power given strong 
brand and acceptance of the product. 

  JFL has traded at an average multiple of 35.3x in its one-year trading history. 

Our target multiple of 28x is a 20% discount to its own trading history and a 15% 
premium to the average of the consumer companies in our coverage, for the 
reasons stated above. 

  Our average valuation for the consumer companies we cover is 23.5x one-year 
forward earnings, with average earnings growth of 20%, which translates into a 
PEG of 1.2x. Over FY10-15F, we expect JFL to deliver an earnings CAGR of 
45%, so a P/E multiple of 28x translates to a PEG multiple of 0.5x.

We also point out that the P/E multiple at which food companies have traded is higher 
than that of the HPC space. One of the reasons is the faster growth trajectory for the 
food names vs. companies in the HPC space. For high-growth companies such as 
Nestle and Titan, the market is willing to pay a higher multiple than for HPC names. 
Thus, valuations for these high-growth companies may look expensive when 
compared to the sector, but the possibility of earnings surprise on the upside and 
higher-than-industry average growth helps to ensure that the trading band itself is 
higher than that for other consumer names. 

Food multiples are higher than 
HPC due to better long-term 
growth prospects

Hence, our one-year forward price target on the stock is Rs620, with potential upside 
of 24% from current levels. We believe that JFL is one of the best possible plays on 
the food opportunity in India and should be the biggest beneficiary of rising 
urbanisation and incomes. We initiate coverage with a BUY rating.

Where could we go wrong? 

Risks to our view 
While we believe JFL offers an attractive entry to the quick service restaurant industry 
in India, there are certain risks which could impede our estimates and price target. We 
see the following risks to our view. 

  Rising input costs: Raw materials such as cheese, dough, vegetables etc 

equalled about 21% of sales in FY10. There has been an increase in the cost of 
these inputs over the last two years, but the company has been able to mitigate the 
impact by having better negotiating power with suppliers, as well as by effecting 
price increases. However, ongoing increases in input prices (cheese, chicken, 
vegetables) could have a negative impact on margins if the company can no longer 
pass those increases on to consumers. 

Rising input costs could lead to 
lower margin progression and is 
a risk to our view

  Rising competition: While pizza remains one of the most popular formats across 
the quick service restaurant industry in India, competition is rising, both from other 
pizza brands as well as other quick service restaurant formats. Brands such as US 
Pizza, Papa Johns, KFC, McDonald’s and Subway are already present in India and 
are looking to increase their presence. There are also other global brands looking 
to enter/grow in India over the next few years, such as Taco Bell, Church’s Chicken, 
and Round Table Pizza, among others, according to company managements. This 
could have a twofold negative impact on Dominos in India, in our view. With 
competition increasing, there could be price-led promotion strategy with a view 
toward gaining share, which could impact profitability. Also with increased choices 
to choose from certainly in the big cities, sales growth could see a slowdown.

franchise agreement (MFA) with Dominos Inc is in effect until December 2024 with 
an option to renew it for another 10 years. The risk of termination of this agreement 
would be if JFL does not comply with preset conditions. However, there is no 
history of Dominos Inc. cancelling franchise agreements across the world.  

  Faster-than-expected rise in leasing costs: Success of the company depends on 
driving new stores into existing cities, as well as expansion into newer towns and 
cities. However, we see two possible risks to this expansion plan. First, availability 
of real estate could be an issue; and second, cost of leasing the properties could 
rise. A significant rise in leasing costs could have a negative impact on profitability 
in the medium term.  

  Slower-than-anticipated success in tier II and tier III towns: One of the key 

long-term drivers for the success of the company is its planned expansion into tier II 
and tier III cities. Management anticipates that these markets will offer a strong 
success rate; however, if this does not pan out as expected, long-term 
attractiveness of the business could suffer. This is a risk to our longer-term 
assumptions.

Strong business model 

Introduced pizza to India 

Globally successful model and brand 

Dominos is a globally recognised brand, and the franchisee model has proven to be 
consistently successful over the past 50 years in many countries including the UK and 
several in Europe and Asia Pacific. Dominos now has more than 8,500 stores 
worldwide across more than 60 countries involving more than 2,000 franchisees. The 
company encourages differentiation across countries, based on local factors both for 
store expansion and menu offerings. For example, in Ireland and the UK, Dominos has 
not given exclusive franchise rights to one franchisee; however in India, Jubilant 
Foodworks has this exclusivity. Menu offerings are also modified to suit local tastes 
and preferences (eg, vegetarian pizza in India, prawn toppings in Australia).

Market leader in a growing market 

Dominos Pizza has a dominant 50% share of the pizza market in India and an even 
higher 65% share of the home-delivery pizza market, according to JFL management. 
We expect the company to maintain its leadership position over the next few years as 
the global brand name and significant scale in India give it a strong competitive 
advantage vs other pizza brands in terms of availability and penetration. The second-
biggest player (Pizza Hut) only has half the number of stores that Dominos has in India, 
which we believe will be a continuing advantage over the medium term.

Pizza: an attractive long-term opportunity  

The pizza market in India remains in a nascent stage, despite the sector’s robust 
growth over the past few years. The current pizza market is worth Rs10bn, which has 
doubled from Rs5bn in 2008, according to the Federation of Indian Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (FICCI). Using macro indicators based on data from McKinsey 
Global and Nomura’s economics team about growing urbanisation trends, the 
increasing number of smaller household size and growing penetration levels, we 
estimate the market itself will be worth Rs51bn (~5x growth) by 2030F on a base-case 
scenario and Rs68bn (~7x growth) in an optimistic scenario.  

Our assumption works with penetration levels of close to 40% from the current 20% 
and average households ordering four pizzas a year (same as current levels, 
according to JFL).

Core market still highly under-penetrated 

We believe the pizza market is still largely under-penetrated in India, even after 
accounting for the robust growth seen over the past decade. Our thesis is based on 
certain assumptions on demographics, market potential and existing store count. We 
find that even in metros such as Mumbai and Delhi, there is still a long way to go 
before we see store count reach full potential.  

We have analysed company business by way of store count in the top 50 cities in India. 
For the purpose of this evaluation, we assumed that each store is able to serve 20,000 
people to operate at an optimal level.  

We find that even cities such as Mumbai and the NCR area are operating only at about 
35-40% penetration. Even looking at the top six cities, if we work with a medium-term 
company target of opening 65 stores pa over the next few years, our model shows that 
there is enough potential for JFL to expand for the next six years. This, however, does 
not take into account the increase in population and urbanisation, which should only 
expand the available opportunity size.  

This essentially implies to us that the company need not even look very aggressively 
at going into smaller cities over the next few years as there is plenty of growth potential 
in the major cities itself.  

It will be quite some time before 
the major cities themselves are 
exhausted, in our view 

Dominos Inc in a recent presentation put the optimal number of stores for India at 750, 
but our analysis suggests that with demand for the product growing at such a fast clip, 
the optimal number of stores could be nearer 1,100 stores.

Smaller cities to lead phase-two growth  

If we look beyond the top six cities, the under-penetration is starker, which means the 
potential for growth is much greater in those cities, in our view. For example, in cities 
such as Ahmedabad, Pune and Surat, the population base is more than 3mn people 
already. These cities are growing in population terms every year and not just by 
natural increase but backed by urbanisation, which means that the potential for store 
count to increase in these cities should be significant.

Increasing urbanisation should provide long-term opportunity 

McKinsey Global estimates that by 2030, based on urbanisation trends, nearly 70% of 
the Indian population will live in urban areas; this implies an attractive longer-term 
opportunity to grow the company’s business in current tier II and tier III cities. For 
instance, according to McKinsey, the population of Kanpur is expected to increase 
from 3.2mn in 2010 to 4.2mn in 2030 (current penetration of 9.3%), and Surat will see 
its population increase from 3.3mn to 7.4mn (current penetration of 9%).

KFC business has been very 
successful in China 

Quick service restaurant model in EMG market – exploring KFC 
growth in China  

We also explored how one of the most successful fast food formats in China has 
evolved over the past couple of decades, becoming the market leader in a country 
where its products were unknown just a few years back. This is similar to Dominos in 
India – whose product was also unknown a few years back. 

In 1987, Kentucky Fried Chicken (now called KFC) became the first fast-food chain to 
open a restaurant in China. Some 20 years later, it has more than 2,200 stores all over 
China with annual revenue of US$1mn each and 20% profit margins. KFC outperforms 
all competitors in China in number of outlets, revenue and market share, according to 
a company presentation. In 2010, the company had more than 3,000 stores vs 
McDonald’s 100 outlets and Burger King’s >30 outlets.  

Tracing back history, by 2001, there were more than 500 KFC outlets all over China. 
By 2008, KFC had twice as many outlets in China as McDonald's, a reversal of the 
ratio in other parts of the world. The company continues to open 350 outlets per year 
even after the robust growth of the past two decades.  

Yum! Brands, parent of KFC, cites many reasons for the huge success of the product, 
but the most important one which still holds in China was acceptance of the product by 
the people in the country. Fried chicken was simply more palatable in China than 
hamburgers, management believes.  

Even after seeing the robust growth in KFC restaurants over the past two decades, the 
company believes that the potential for the number of stores to be opened in China 
remains robust. Currently, there are about 300mn people in China who are in the 
middle class by local standards, according to a recent YUM! presentation. By 2030, 
the company believes there will be at least 750mn people in the middle-class segment. 
If KFC continues to operate the same ratio of restaurants per million middle-class 
persons as it does now, management sees potential to open another 4,500 KFC 
restaurants. If the company increases the number of restaurants serving one million 
middle-class citizens, the potential for store count could even be 5x greater than 
current levels. That would still be much lower than the density of McDonald’s 
restaurants in the US or Tim Horton’s in Canada, based on according to YUM!.

While our bottom-up analysis suggests Dominos could open more than 1,000 stores in 
India (over the next 15 years), we believe this estimate could be conservative if we 
look at how successful quick service restaurants have been in China. While we do not 
think building in such robust longer-term potential into our model is justified, we 
highlight that long-term potential could take a different trajectory to what we currently 
forecast. We note some common success factors between JFL’s India operations and 
KFC in China in terms of product innovation, robust supply chain and consumer 
acceptance of its products.  

Dominos versus other pizza brands 

While the pizza market in India has seen robust growth over the past decade or so, the 
Dominos brand has grown at a faster pace. We attribute this to: 

  Concentration on market depth and breadth: Dominos entered the Indian pizza 
market in the mid-1990s, and until 2003, the company was growing broadly in line 
with the second-biggest competitor Pizza Hut. For example in 2003, Dominos had 
75 stores in India, while Pizza Hut had 70 stores. Yet over the next seven years, 
Dominos grew its number of stores to 306; Pizza Hut now has only 158 stores. The 
company has been aggressively growing the depth of existing markets (8 Mumbai 
stores in 2003; 55 in 2010) and ventured into newer cities such as Bhopal, 
Bhubaneswar and Cochin. We think this ability to take the brand into newer 
markets and deepen penetration in existing markets is unmatched across the 
industry, which has made the company the market leader in India’s pizza segment. 
This, we believe, is one of the most important factors in the success of the brand. 
Given the logistical challenges, proximity to the consumer is most important, in our 
view.  

  Brand strength: The company has invested a significant amount of money in 
branding and consumer awareness over the past decade. We think this has 
ensured that consumers connected with the brand “emotionally” based on feedback 
from the company, which the company has leveraged to grow its business faster in 
existing cities and take the brand into other cities. In the past couple of years, it has 
invested Rs304mn in advertising and promotion (A&P). In our view, although 
operating leverage means the proportion of money spent on A&P should continue 
to trend down over the next few years (as already happened in FY10), we see the 
absolute amount spent remaining significant. We think this means that connections 
with consumers will continue to get stronger. The company’s advertising campaign, 
“Khusion ki home delivery”, has nurtured a strong emotional connect with the 
consumer, in our view, and this has helped the company attract consumers and 
made it easier to retain them whenever they plan to order a pizza.  

  Focus on home-delivery model: JFL has consistently given the message that its 
focus is on the home-delivery segment. We think many of the stores across the 
country have some space for dine in, but the company’s branding message has 
emphasised that it specialises in home delivery. This has had a few positives for 
the company in our view. 

  The message to the consumer has been clear and consistent in terms of 

branding and made the company the preferred option for pizza home delivery. 

Nomura 

80

21 February 2011 

 
 
 
Jubilant Foodworks 

Manish Jain

  The company has been able to grow the number of stores in a more robust 
manner versus competition as the space requirement for a largely home 
delivery-based model is much smaller versus the dine-in option. 

  Profitability has been better as rentals for a smaller space are much lower 

versus a dine-in restaurant in a mall or a commercial area. This means the dine-
in option is slower to develop and the company has been able to grow 
profitability faster due to operating leverage. 

  Innovation: One of the key success factors for JFL in our view has been the focus 
on innovation and “Indianisation” of the menu. Half the menu has always been 
vegetarian, and management has pointed out that in a country like India where the 
majority of consumers are vegetarian, this was critical. We think that this is where 
Dominos and McDonald’s have succeeded, in that from the first day of operation, 
there was an elaborate vegetarian menu which was not the case with KFC when it 
launched in India. JFL has over the years continued to focus on innovation to keep 
the menu “fresh and exciting”, in our view.  

  Focus on front-end: During the first phase of its development, JFL concentrated 

on developing the front-end of its business and tried to connect with the consumer. 
The back-end, including the supply chain and logistics, came a bit later once the 
front-end was established. This is a message which we have also received from 
Pantaloon Retail (India’s biggest food retailer) regarding its food business in terms 
of back-end and supply chain, sourcing, and benefits of scale: while the back-end is 
important to drive efficiency, the primary focus on developing the back-end first is 
not generally a great way to go about developing the business according to 
Pantaloon management.  

  Availability with affordability: While JFL’s focus has been on making the product 
available to more consumers throughout the country, it also has tried to make the 
product affordable to a larger section of the population. The company’s pricing 
strategy shows that despite being the market leader, comparable prices for the 
basic varieties of pizza and up to the higher-end range are less than those of most 
comparable brands. The company launched innovative products such as “Pizza 
Mania” which start at Rs39 per pizza, making it affordable to a large section of the 
population.

Operating leverage in the model starting to emerge 

We believe that the Dominos model in India carries a significant amount of operating 
leverage. In our view, the best way to understand this is to construct a store-level P&L 
and do a bottom-up analysis to see how the operating leverage works in the Dominos 
model in India.  

Given available demographic data the way company looks at it, we assume the 
average number of households in a catchment area at 20,000, and each household 
orders four pizzas per year. We assume that the number of orders per year grows by 
~10% each year over the first five years of a store’s opening. We believe the average 
ticket size increases by 6-8% each year (4-5% pricing and 2-3% mix improvement).  

Nomura

We assume rental increases run slightly ahead of the long-term (15 years) inflation 
rate (assumption 6%) at 9%. However, as sales growth outstrips rental growth in our 
model, there is a significant amount of operating leverage which flows through to the 
bottom line. Similarly with SG&A and A&P expenses, the rise in these line items is well 
below the rise in sales, which means margins see a marked improvement in our model. 
The overall impact of these moves is that we find margins improve by close to 350-
400bps over the first five years of operation after store opening.  

To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we back-tested it by calculating the 
payback period for each store. Company comments suggest a payback period of close 
to three years for most stores. Our model assumes a payback period of slightly more 
than three years, which means our assumptions maybe conservative, particularly in 
the first three years of operation.  

We believe this model is replicated across the company, such that as the percentage 
of older stores rises, margins for the company rise. JFL has achieved a certain scale 
and new stores may number 65-70 per year over the next three years, in our view. 
This translates to a new-store contribution of 12-18% as a percentage of existing 
stores over the next three years. As such, we expect the company should benefit from 
operating leverage and margin expansion over the next few years.

Dominos model elsewhere demonstrates strong operating 
leverage 

We also looked at how the Dominos franchisee model has evolved in other markets. 
We see a marked similarity in many other markets in terms of the existence of 
operating leverage. For example, we looked at the UK market to see how the Dominos 
business has evolved there over the past decade or so. As the company expanded its 
footprint in the country, it reports that sales more than doubled in 2001-06 and profits 
increased by almost 5x. Margins improved from 3% in 2001 to 5.9% in 2006. Despite 
many years of operations and a robust store count in the country (600), operating 
leverage continued to increase according to management. In 2009, margins improved 
to 7.3%, and with store additions continuing to be a factor over the next decade, they 
could increase to 12% over the next decade. This is a 9% increase in margins over 20 
years, which means that margins typically keep improving marginally as store count 
increases.

Over the past few years, the company has invested in a robust back-end supply chain 
system, to ensure stable product availability and control costs. The company tries to 
open stores near a city as it makes it easier to reach those stores with one trip from the 
commissary, minimising travel and freight costs. The supply of raw materials is 
regulated through four regional centres or commissaries in Noida, Mumbai, Bangalore 
and Kolkata. These commissaries primarily manufacture the dough and act as a 
warehouse for most of the other ingredients. Two of the company’s commissaries also 
process pasta and three of them process Choco Lava Cake. The raw materials are 
sourced and supplied to the stores by the commissaries. The company has signed 
with multiple vendors for its input and raw material requirements, which reduces supply 
risks, in our view. The idea behind this is to ensure that each commissary is able to 
reach every store in the country within one day to supply raw materials. There are, 
however, a small number of stores which source requirements locally as it is not 
possible to reach these stores within one day.  

Scale gives better bargaining power with suppliers; India a key 
growth driver 

According to the company, Dominos Inc regularly evaluates the potential number of 
stores across all its markets. We have looked at how the company is faring in its top 10 
markets and where it sees the potential for growth. In 2009, the company estimated 
that the ideal number of stores in India is about 700. However, seeing the robust pace 
of growth both in store count and in the business, it increased this number to 750 in its 
latest investor presentation. India is one of only two countries where the company has 
increased its potential store count target among the top 10 markets, the other one 
being the UK. The pace of growth of stores in India over the past year has moved India 
up from being the company’s sixth-biggest market to its fourth largest as at end 2010. 
If the pace continues, India could become the third-biggest market for Dominos 
worldwide by the end of FY12F, in our view.  

We believe the actual store potential in India is closer to 1,100 stores based on our 
bottom-up analysis, which would put it on par with the UK as the number one market in 
terms of store potential. Over the longer term, management believes the attractiveness 
of having 1,100 stores serve a population of more than a billion people is much more 
than having the same number of stores serve a population of 60mn (as in the UK). 
Over the next five years, we see India becoming the most important market for 
Dominos worldwide.

Opportunity to bring other quick service restaurant brands to 
India 

One of the biggest opportunities for JFL in the near to medium term is to bring other 
quick service restaurant brands into India. Recent press articles (Economic Times, 8 
February 2011, “Jubilant in talks with Starbucks for India Foray”) reported the JFL was 
in discussions with Starbucks Coffee to bring Starbucks outlets to India, although 
Starbucks has entered into a partnership with Tata Coffee for its foray into India. 
However, Tata Coffee in a press release suggested that this partnership may only be 
for sourcing of coffee beans; thus, a partnership to roll out retail stores with another 
company may still be possible. We believe there are other international chains that do 
not have a presence in India that JFL may look to bring into India. According to JFL 
management, they are in talks with two brands and may be bringing one of them into 
India over the next six months. We think any related announcement or newsflow could 
prove to be a strong medium-term catalyst for the stock. Management’s success and 
experience with leading a new brand into India is established, in our view, and 
investors would likely look at such a development favourably.

Industry analysis 

Indian food industry 
The Indian food industry is estimated to be worth US$200bn in 2007 and is expected 
to grow to US$300bn by 2015F as per Technopak. This growth (CAGR of 5.2%) will be 
helped by consumers spending more in absolute terms on their food requirements, 
although as incomes rise, the percentage of income spent on food will decline we 
expect. We think there will also be a change in terms of consumer food basket as 
incomes continue to rise and look for preferences to shift from basic food grains, edible 
oil and sugar to include fruits and vegetables, meat, eggs, fish, beverages and 
processed foods.  

Food service industry to benefit from this growth 

The food service industry is defined as sale of food and drinks which are ready for 
consumption either from premises from which they were bought, in designated eating 
areas or delivered to home. This industry is sizeable, but largely unorganised in India. 
The Food Franchising Report 2009, an industry report published by the Federation of 
Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) estimates that the food services 
industry was US$12.4bn in 2008, of which only US$1.7bn was in the organised sector. 
Within the organised sector, some of the formats are fine dining, casual dining, quick 
service restaurants, food courts, cafés and kiosks. Within these formats quick service 
restaurants and cafés are the fastest-growing formats over the past few years, 
according to the report. 

Key drivers of the food service industry 

The food service industry in India is likely to grow strongly over the next few years and 
we note several structural triggers that should support this growth. 

  Rising income levels: One of the key determinants for the success of quick 

service restaurants is improving affordability of the products on offer. With per 
capita incomes in India continuing to rise and expected to be buoyant over the next 
few years (based on a McKinsey Global Institute report), one of the key 
beneficiaries should be the quick service restaurant as disposable income 
continues to rise.

  Younger population: India is a young country (median age of the population is 24 
years, according to the US census bureau). This has a big influence on the growth 
of the quick service restaurant industry, and this factor should remain supportive in 
the medium term, in our view.

  Rising urbanisation: Based on data compiled by McKinsey Global Institute, over 

the past decade, we have seen increasing trends of urbanisation, and this will likely 
remain a trend over the next decade. Moreover, the fastest-growing states will 
continue to exhibit the highest urbanisation rate. By 2008, an estimated 340mn 
people lived in urban India, representing ~30% of the total population. However, 
McKinsey estimates suggest that over the next 20 years, 70% of all the incremental 
jobs created in India are likely to be in urban India and these jobs are likely to be 
twice as productive as equivalent jobs in rural India. Thus, the population of India’s 
cities is expected to increase to 590mn or 40% of India’s population will live in the 
cities in 2030. This should be supportive for the long-term growth of the quick 
service restaurant industry, in our view.

  Increase in nuclear families and rising number of women in the workforce: As 

urbanisation trends take shape in India, families are becoming smaller. The 
McKinsey data also shows a trend of an increasing number of women in the 
workforce, which means there is less time to cook at home, which in turn should be 
a positive for growth of the quick service restaurant industry in India over the 
medium term, we believe.

Quick service restaurant industry: robust growth in recent 
years 

As discussed, the quick service restaurant industry has seen robust growth over the 
past few years. This has been supported by several structural macroeconomic triggers, 
as well as the industry recognising the opportunity and investing in improving the 
availability and affordability of the product. This has been true across various quick 
service restaurant formats such as pizza (both delivery and dine in), cafés, burgers 
and fried chicken restaurants.

However, within the quick service restaurant industry, the two most dominant 
segments in terms of growth have been pizza and cafés. Pizza stores have increased 
in number by 3x over the past seven years according to a FICCI food franchising 
report. Dominos has been the leader in the pizza segment and has grown its number 
of stores from 75 in 2003 to 306 in 2010 and is on course add another 70 stores by the 
end of March 2011, according to the company. This translates to 4x the number of 
stores and is ahead of industry growth. The second-biggest competitor is almost half 
the size of Dominos, which is a huge advantage in a market which is growing at an 
attractive pace.  

The café segment has also been growing strongly, although the market is more 
consolidated with Café Coffee Day almost 5x as big as the second-largest competitor, 
with the big two having a dominant share of more than 90% in terms of number of 
stores, according to the company.  

Opportunity size will continue to grow 

We also believe the opportunity for out-of-home food is likely to grow significantly over 
the next few years as it benefits from favourable demographics, rising urbanisation and 
strong growth in incomes. Out-of-home food only constitutes 5% of disposable income 
according to Images India as of 2009. As incomes grow, share of food and grocery 
should continue to trend down and these savings will likely be spent by the consumer 
on discretionary items. One of the most popular segments in India, in our view, will 
remain food, and here we expect to see more consumers shift from the unorganised 
sector out-of-home food to the organised segment. We think this will be a key positive 
for JFL in the longer term.

Consumer acceptance will continue to drive long-term growth 

As mentioned, one of the key success factors in the food segment is consumer 
acceptance of the product and the format. This is a significant positive for JFL as the 
product and the format are now well accepted by consumers, which means there is an 
inherent bias from the consumer towards spending on the product. It is important that 
in a country like India, the basic ingredient in a pizza is vegetarian. This is feedback we 
also received from one of the company’s competitors in the QSR segment – KFC India. 
According to KFC, it has had to endure a much more challenging path to convince the 
consumer to try its products as the most important product is chicken. We believe 
McDonald’s success in India was helped by the company’s introducing a vegetarian 
option at the onset.

Appendix 

Feedback from 3Q FY11 conference 
call — company data 
  Store expansion plans on track: The company remains committed to increasing 
the store count by ~70 stores in FY12. In FY11, it has already opened 58 new 
stores over the first nine months with 28 stores added in 3Q. We believe there 
could be upside potential to the 70 new store count in FY11, but are not building it 
in to our numbers.  

  Price hikes as planned: The company took price hikes of 2-2.5% at the end of the 
September quarter. This is in line with company policy of taking such quantum of 
price hikes every six months, which helps to ensure that consumers do not feel 
impacted by price hikes and the value proposition. 

  Employee cost: In 3Q FY11, there was a significant increase in employee costs of 
+78% y-y on account of salary hikes in the range of 16-17% across the stores, as 
well as bringing shift managers under the variable compensation scheme linked to 
growth of EBITDA at the store level. This was also impacted by higher number of 
temporary employees who are hired specifically to handle the seasonal pick-up in 
business in 3Q each year on account of the holiday season. 

  New cities showing good traction: During the quarter, the company entered eight 
new cities including Patna, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar and Zirakpur. The company’s 
assessment is that initial feedback has been extremely positive with stores doing 
better than expectations. Management believes that in some of cities, one store will 
be good enough for a period of one year or so, while in other cities, it opened the 
second store soon after opening the first store. Consumer acceptance has been 
more rapid than the company’s initial estimate, according to management, and this 
bodes well for longer-term growth in these cities. 

  Capex: The company has planned capex of Rs550mn in FY11, which should grow 
by a bit in FY12 as it plans 70 new store additions. The company expects it will be 
able to generate funds internally for new store expansions. 

  Debt and cash position: JFL has no debt on the balance sheet. We believe net 
cash will improve further as capex requirements will eventually be less than the 
company’s cash generation over the next couple of years. 

  Talks with more international QSR brands: The company is in talks with two 

major international QSR brands with a view to bringing the brand into India over the 
next four to six months, according to management. The company is still talking to 
both brands and will look at finalising only one of them over the near term.  

  Margin improvement: The company believes that margins will continue to improve 
marginally over the next couple of years as operating leverage gels. We believe the 
company’s own guidance is conservative and think margin improvement could 
reach ~100bps each year over the next couple of years. 

  International expansion: The company plans to start its first store in Sri Lanka at 
the end of March or early April and will grow the number of stores in that country 
depending on consumer response. Management believes India is a more attractive 
opportunity than Sri Lanka and will continue to focus on India.

Background 

Company background 
Jubilant Foodworks, part of the Jubilant Bhartia group, holds the master franchise 
agreement (MFA) for the Dominos Pizza brand in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri 
Lanka. The company, earlier known as Dominos Pizza India Ltd, was founded in 1995

Dominos Pizza brand was launched in India in 1996 and has grown rapidly to become 
the market leader in both the overall pizza market, as well as the home-delivery 
segment. The company started its expansion process slowly and up until 2003, had 
about 75 stores in India. However, over the past few years, the company increased its 
pace of expansion significantly, and it now has twice as many stores as the second-
largest competitor in the market. This focus on increasing penetration in existing cities 
has also helped to make Dominos is one of the most profitable names across the food 
service industry in India, in our view.  

Competition in India’s domestic pizza market is very strong, with new entrants such as 
Papa Johns and Garcia’s Pizza starting up shop recently and international chain 
California Pizza Kitchen now also entering India. However, we believe the market itself 
will growth at ~9% CAGR over the next 20 years, driven by increasing urbanisation, 
penetration into smaller cities and towns and increasing incidence of orders in major 
cities. We expect the Dominos brand to be one of the key beneficiaries of this growth.

beverage drink market in India. With penetration levels still low for the product, we 
believe the long-term opportunity remains attractive. The company’s focus on 
leveraging the Horlicks brand to build other categories will deliver diversification 
benefits over the next few years, in our view. We initiate with a BUY rating. 

 Catalysts 

Increasing penetration levels for malted drinks, diversification into other food 
categories and option on large cash on balance sheet are potential catalysts. 

 Anchor themes 

The processed food sector in India is one of the most attractive segments in the 
consumer space. The segment is currently largely focussed on urban India, where 
increasing income and changing demographics are helping to drive demand. 
Longer term, rural India presents a largely untapped market for processed foods.

 Market leader in a growing category  

GSK Consumer is the market leader in the growing malted drinks 
market in India with a ~70% share. With industry revenue growth 
expected to be 18-19%, on our estimates, and GSK growing above 
that trend, we believe it is best placed to deliver strong earnings 
growth over the next two years. 

 Strong earnings growth 

We expect the company to deliver strong 21% earnings CAGR over 
CY10-12F which is significantly higher than the average for the Indian 
HPC companies we cover on the back of increasing penetration of its 
products and improving profitability. 

 Category penetration still low 

Despite the Horlicks brand being in existence for over 30 years, 
category penetration for malted drinks as a category is still low at 
~20%. We believe this is a big positive, as the category is a long way 
off from being saturated. 

 Diversification will be a long-term catalyst 

The company is now looking to leverage its Horlicks brand to drive 
entry into other categories. We believe this will be a positive catalyst 
in the longer term, as it builds other growth drivers. GSK Consumer 
has already successfully launched Horlicks Foodles (instant noodles 
category) and Lucozade (sports drinks category) recently.  

 Initiate with a BUY and price target of Rs2,505 

We initiate coverage with a BUY rating and a Rs2,505 price target, 
representing 19% upside from current levels. We believe GSK 
Consumer is a solid long-term play in the India consumer space.

Dominant market leader in an underpenetrated segment 

Executive summary 
  Main product category underpenetrated. 

  Processed foods/drinks is the one of the most attractive categories in FMCG. 

  Long-term opportunity to drive penetration in rural areas. 

  Valuation still inexpensive vs FMCG peers.  

  Rising input costs and consumers switching into other categories are risks to our 

call. 

Long-term value drivers for the company 
  Main product category underpenetrated: Penetration levels remain fairly low at 
just about 20% in the malted beverage category, and management believes there 
is scope for increasing the category size over the longer term. Market penetration is 
more skewed to South and East India (45% penetration), while penetration in North 
and West India remains low (10%). 

Malted beverage category is still 
underpenetrated, providing a 
long-term growth opportunity 

  Still largely urban focused: In terms of mix, 70% of the company's sales come 
from urban markets, thus there is a large, unexplored rural market. The company 
has introduced lower-priced packs in the rural markets, which it hopes will 
persuade consumers to try out its products. 

Largely focuses on urban 
markets with market share close 
to 70% 

  Rural markets could provide long-term upside: GSK Consumer is aggressively 
looking to expand its presence in rural markets. It recently launched value Horlicks 
at Rs80 for a 500g pack (a discount of 50% to normal Horlicks). It has also 
activated various price points targeted at consumer aspirations, which it believes 
will fuel growth in rural markets. 

Catalysts that we believe will move the stock 
  Success in driving penetration levels 

  Innovation into other categories 

  Potential large dividend payout 

Driving higher penetration levels, 
success in other categories and a 
large dividend payout are 
catalysts which will drive stock 
price 

Malt-based drinks category dominated by GSK Consumer 

The malt-based drinks category accounts for ~95% of company revenues. The total 
market for this category is around ~Rs23-25bn, according to GSK Consumer. The 
company’s brands under this category include Horlicks, Boost, Viva and Moltova. 
These products are mixed with milk and consumed. Penetration levels remain fairly 
low at just about 20% in the country, and management believes there is scope for 
increasing the category size over the longer term. Along with GSK Consumer, other 
companies in the category are Cadbury, H.J. Heinz and some local players.

Valuation methodology 

We have used a sum-of-the-parts methodology to value GSK Consumer. Our valuation 
is based on a P/E multiple of 25x on the core business. The core business net income 
excludes interest income. We have valued the cash on the balance sheet at book 
value. Based on this valuation methodology, we arrive at our target price of Rs2,505. 
The detailed breakdown is as below. 

  We value the core business at 25x CY12F earnings excluding the interest earned 
from investments. We estimate core EPS of Rs76.9 in CY11and Rs94.3 in CY12. 
This gives us core business per share value of Rs2,325. 

  The company also had cash of Rs8.4bn as at December 2009, which we estimate 

will rise to Rs8.6bn in CY10F. This gives us per share value of Rs180. 

  Our cumulative target price thus adds up to Rs2,505, which represents ~19% 

potential upside from current levels.  

Target multiple in line with consumer average 

Our target multiple for GSK Consumer is based on 25x CY12F core earnings. GSK 
Consumer has over the past seven years traded at 15.6x one-year forward P/E, but 
this does not take into account the P/E re-rating that the stock has seen over the past 
couple of years, which reflects the improved operational metrics of the company and 
its renewed focus on innovation.  

Working capital metrics have seen a strong improvement, and we believe this is likely 
to continue for the medium term. This has led to a P/E re-rating towards the wider 
consumer average. One of the reasons the company historically traded at a discount 
to the wider consumer sector was its over-reliance on just one category for a large 
majority of its revenues and profits. Malted drinks (Horlicks, Boost, Moltova and Viva 
brands) contributed close to 96% of sales in CY06. We estimate this will come down 
closer to 91% by CY13F as other categories become meaningfully large.  

On a PEG basis, the company still trades at a discount to peers. With the company 
expected to post 21% profit growth over the next couple of years, on our estimates, 
GSK Consumer offers one of the most attractive growth profiles among consumer 
companies in India. The P/E re-rating reflects this improved growth potential and we 
believe the stock will now trade higher than its consumer peers’ long-term average of 
24-25x one-year-forward earnings (on Nomura estimates).  

We initiate coverage with a Buy 
rating and TP of Rs. 2,505 
potential upside of 19%

Risks to our investment view 

Consumer switching out of malt-based drinks 

One risk to our price target is that consumers move out of malt-based drinks category 
into other categories. However, we see little risk of that happening with the category 
still underpenetrated and brands across the market having strong brand equity. The 
recent exit of Nestle India’s brand Milo from the category points to strong entry barriers, 
with new players finding it difficult to dislodge existing incumbents.   

Rising input costs and a slower-
than-expected increase in 
penetration levels for the category 
are risks to our view 

Rising input costs 

The main input costs for the company are milk powder, liquid milk, malt and malt 
extract, and wheat. Milk prices have been stable over the past few months, and with 
government initiatives to encourage an increase in milk production, we believe 
increased supply will continue to keep a tab on milk prices. GSK Consumer has long-
term contracts with suppliers and the ability to source large amounts, which gives it 
some bargaining power in terms of input costs.

Longer term volumes should 
grow inline with industry with 
price/mix slightly better 

GSK Consumer Healthcare 

Manish Jain

Financial analysis 

Revenue drivers in place 
  Price/mix benefits to drive revenue growth ahead of volume growth, in our view. 

  Diversification into newer categories could yield benefits over the longer term.  

  Margin is likely to trend higher as the company benefits from operating leverage, 

cost savings and mix improvement.  

  Balance sheet supportive for acquisitions or increased shareholder returns.  

Volumes growth in line with industry, but price/mix better 

GSK Consumer operates in some fast-growing categories such as malt-based drinks 
and instant noodles. Volume growth in these categories is expected to be strong over 
the next couple of years, and we think this should help GSK deliver solid volume 
growth in the medium term (over the next 5-10 years).  

In malt-based drinks, GSK is by far the largest player in the industry, with a market 
share of 70%, almost 3x the share of its nearest competitor, Cadbury India (unlisted). 
The company’s efforts have been focused primarily around helping the category grow.  

Even though the company commands a lion’s share in the category and incremental 
market share gains may be difficult, we believe given the significant under-penetration 
of malt-based drinks in large parts of the country, average volume growth of  ~11% 
should be readily achievable over the near to medium term.  

In addition, we have also built a price increase/mix improvement of 4-5% into our 
model. We believe this should help the company deliver value growth of 18% over the 
next couple of years in the category.  

In instant noodles, we estimate volume growth to be ahead of the industry at 25-30% 
with price/mix of ~6-7% over the next couple of years. This has been one new product 
which has met with success, and we view it as a likely future growth driver for GSK.  

Overall, we expect company to deliver a revenue CAGR of 21% over FY10-12F. We 
are not building in upside from any other product launches over the next few years. For 
instance, Lucozade sports drink has already been launched, and we expect the brand 
to gain traction, but we have not incorporated it into our forecasts.

Margin performance expected to benefit from better price/mix 

GSK Consumer reported EBITDA margins of 19.3% in CY10, which was up 30bps 
compared with CY09. Going into CY11F, we expect operating margins to improve, by 
40bps to 19.7%. While we do acknowledge that rising milk and barley prices are likely 
to put pressure on margins, we believe aggressive pricing action (5% price hike in the 
past three months) should help alleviate some of the margin pressure.  

We believe with the GSK Consumer’s brand equity having become stronger over the 
past five years, the company can now make more price increases than in the past.

Balance sheet strong, provides optionality on cash  

The company has historically had a strong balance sheet. However, since 2007, it has 
made various changes in its operating environment, particularly on working capital. For 
instance, debtor days, which were close to 21 in 2002 have now moved to 6. Working 
capital days have moved from 9 in 2008 to -30 in 2009.  

Company has a strong balance 
sheet which gives optionality on 
use of cash for larger dividend 
payout or acquisitions 

These moves have resulted in significant improvement in the company’s working 
capital requirements, which have meant that cash balance on the books rose from 
Rs937mn in CY07 to Rs8.2bn in CY10. Although we expect the increase from these 
levels to be more moderate in future, we still expect the company’s cash balance to 
rise in the absence of a large dividend payout.  

GSK Consumer management has stated that it does not plan on giving out a special 
dividend, but is continually looking at ways to deploy the cash. We believe, however, 
that some part of this will be given out as a special dividend, but the timeline on this is 
unclear to us.  

The company has incurred a large amount of capex this year (Rs1.2bn) to set up a 
plant to increase its manufacturing capacity to meet increased demand over the next 
few years. We believe capex will revert to the long-term average of Rs250-300mn over 
the next few years. However, we believe that the company’s plans to branch out into 
other categories as well as to leverage Horlicks brand further will require some 
additional investment.

Capex plans executed as planned 

The company invested ~Rs1.2bn in CY10 on capex in order to set up a new factory to 
augment its production capabilities. We believe this will be a long-term positive, as the 
company should consequently have enough capacity to meet the steady growth in 
demand over the next few years.  

Company to remain in the full tax bracket 

GSK Consumer has been in the full tax bracket. We estimate tax rates will be ~33% 
over the next few years. 

Strong 21% net profit CAGR expected over CY10-CY12F 

We expect company to deliver 21% net income growth over the next two years. This 
will be led by strong revenue growth (we estimate an average of 22% over the next 
two years) and operating margin profile (we estimate an average of 19.8% over the 
next two years). The company also offers the added incentive of a potentially large 
cash dividend payout over and above the 30% growth in dividends we have modelled 
for the next couple of years.

Valuation 

Valuation reasonable on PEG basis 
  We use a sum-of-the-parts price target methodology, based on a 25x multiple for 

the core business and cash valued at book value. 

  Increasing penetration of the products and a potential large dividend payout could 
be catalysts for the share price. Additionally, the success of newer products, 
particularly Noodles, could be an additional catalyst.  

  Competition remains strong from Heinz and Cadbury, but GSK continues to hold its 

share.  

Target price methodology 

We have used a sum-of-the-parts valuation for GSK Consumer.  

  We value the core business on a P/E multiple of 25x CY12F core earnings 

(excluding the non-operating other income). For CY12F, we estimate core net 
income of Rs3.9bn and value the core business at a 7% discount to the multiple 
assigned to Nestle. This gives us a core business per share value of Rs2,325. 

  Company also has cash of Rs7.5bn as at December 2010. We value the cash at 

book value as at CY10. This gives us per share value of Rs180. 

  Our cumulative target price thus adds up to Rs2,505, which represents ~19% 

upside potential from current levels.   

Stock re-rating likely to continue 

Our target multiple for GSK Consumer is based on a P/E multiple of 25x one-year-
forward earnings. GSK Consumer has historically traded at average 15.5x one-year-
forward P/E, but this does not take into account the P/E re-rating that the stock has 
seen over the past couple of years, which reflects the improved operational metrics of 
the company and renewed focus on innovation.  

We believe that our assigned multiple is fair, largely on account of the following:  

  Accelerated growth trajectory likely to sustain: GSK’s growth has seen a strong 
upturn over the past few years, as the market for malted beverages has taken off, 
especially in urban markets. With GSK the market leader in the segment, a 
significant part of market development has been led by the company, and this has, 
in turn, also resulted in the company benefiting the most from the market’s growth. 

For instance, average realization was less than 2% during the period from CY03 to 
CY06. Volume growth also averaged 7% during this period. This led to investors 
looking at this stock as more of a commodity play with high single-digit volume 
growth and low single-digit pricing gains.  

However, since CY07, volume growth has consistently averaged more than 10%, 
with realisations also moving up to ~6%. We believe this is on the back of greater 
acceptance of the company’s products, and hence reduced elasticity of product 
volumes vs pricing.

  Increased focus on innovation and portfolio diversification: GSK Consumer 
has over the past few years aggressively grown its biscuits and instant noodles 
businesses. This was done with the specific aim of ‘de-risking’ the business model 
from the malted beverage category. The company has not only been able to 
establish these businesses, but has also grown them aggressively and has become 
a serious competitor in these segments. For instance, in the noodles segment, 
GSK Consumer now has close to 3% share of the Indian market. Additionally, the 
company’s focus on innovation means that new products should account for 25% of 
incremental sales over the next couple of years, according to the company. 
Recently the company has also said that it plans to leverage its Horlicks brand for 
its foray into other categories such as breakfast cereals and mid-day meals. In 
addition, the company recently launched the Lucozade sports drinks line, which 
should add to the attractiveness of the longer-term business model. This, we 
believe, is likely to keep the trading multiple closer to the consumer average.  

  Working capital metrics have seen a strong improvement that are likely to continue 
in the medium term. This has been one of the reasons for the P/E multiple re-rating, 
in our view.   

On a PEG basis, the company still trades at a discount to its peers. With the company 
expected, by our estimates, to post 21% profit growth over the next couple of years, GSK 
Consumer offers one of the best growth profiles among consumer companies in India. 
The P/E re-rating reflects this improved growth potential, and we believe stock will now 
trade marginally higher than the consumer peers’ long-term average of 24-25x one-year-
forward earnings.

Trading at a fair discount to Nestle  

If we look at the trading multiple at which GSK trades and compare it with that of 
Nestle, we see that GSK is trading at a significant 27% discount. While the stock has 
historically traded at a discount to Nestle, we believe there is a case for that discount 
vs. Nestle to narrow over the next few years.  

This has already partly happened, with the discount to Nestle narrowing from 50% at 
the start of 2009 to 27% currently. However, we expect the discount to narrow 
gradually even more as the company executes on its stated objectives.

Conclusion 

We believe GSK Consumer is one of the most attractive stories across the FMCG 
space in India. Its market leadership position in the underpenetrated malted beverage 
space, forays into the fast-growing biscuits and instant noodles spaces and exposure 
to niche categories such as sports drinks make it one the most attractive stories to own 
across the FMCG space in India, in our view. We initiate coverage with a BUY rating 
and a price target of Rs2,505, representing potential upside of 19% from current levels.

Where could we go wrong? 

Risks to our view  
We believe GSK Consumer is well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth over 
the next two years. However, risks to our view and the achievement of our price target 
come from rising input costs and category penetration growing slower than our 
expectations.  

Rising input prices, lower than 
expected increase in penetration 
levels present risks to our 
estimates 

Rising input prices 

Going into the next few quarters, one of the challenges that the company faces is 
rising commodity costs. Prices for some of its principal inputs such as milk (accounting 
for ~40% of the input cost basket) and barley (accounting for ~35 of the input cost 
basket) have risen steadily over the past 12 months. While barley prices have risen by 
an average 24% in CY10, milk prices have firmed up 25% during the same period.  

Our analysis shows that for every 1% increase in milk price, profit declines 0.3%, all 
else remaining constant. Furthermore, for every 1% increase in the price of barley, 
profits declines 0.4%, all else remaining constant.

High category penetration in key regions 

Category penetration levels have steadily increased as more consumers are able to 
afford the company’s products. This is particularly true for the southern and eastern 
parts of the country, which account for >80% of revenue. Remember, these regions 
are typically milk-deficient states, which is one of the main reasons for the popularity of 
malt-based drinks. The northern and western parts of India still have very low 
penetration and are traditionally the milk-rich belts.  

However, penetration levels are still low even in urban India. We are building in a 15% 
revenue growth trajectory over the next couple of years based on our expectations of 
increasing penetration and strong volume growth, as demand continues to be strong.

Industry growth prospects strong; GSK Consumer is the dominant market leader 

Malt-based drinks to remain the mainstay 
Malt-based drink additives are products which are added into hot or cold milk, to 
enhance the nutritional value as well as taste of milk.  

Malt based drinks segment to 
account for majority of revenues 

One of the long-standing concerns on GSK has been that it’s largely a single product 
company, with malt-based drinks accounting for more than 90% of its consolidated 
revenues. While the company has been addressing this concern by proactively 
diversifying into many new categories, we believe that going into the next few years, 
malt-based drinks (Horlicks, in particular) will continue to account for the lion’s share of 
GSK Consumer’s revenues. In fact, the company itself has set a target of bringing 
down its dependence on malt-based drinks to 80% over the next few years, which 
could be a stiff challenge in our view. 

We have also looked at how company P&L may look in FY20F.  

We expect malt-based foods to grow at a value CAGR of ~11%, biscuits to grow 20-
21%, instant noodles to grow 23-25% from a relatively lower base and nutrition bars to 
growth at 25%.  

Our calculations show that even after fairly robust growth in all the new categories, 
malt-based drinks would still account for ~85% of revenues.

While the company continues to focus on reducing its dependence on malt-based 
drinks over the medium term, we believe this will be a gradual process. There are two 
reasons for this.  

  First, given the size of the malt-based drinks segment for the company, for new 

categories to become meaningful in size would take a significant amount of time, 
even if the company grows faster than the segment (eg noodles, biscuits).  

  Second, the market for malt-based drinks is itself underpenetrated, with North and 
West India still offering significant headroom for the company to grow. Even in 
South and East India, where penetration levels are higher, GSK Consumer 
continues to focus on increasing the consumption level. This means, in our view, 
the malt-based drinks segment itself should continue to grow over the medium term. 

Penetration uneven across the country, significant opportunity 

The company’s sales mix for malt-based drinks is spread unevenly across the country, 
with South India the dominant region, contributing ~50% of total sales in CY10, 
according to the company. East India is also a sizeable contributor at 37% of sales.

This intuitively suggests that penetration levels in North and West India are below the 
pan-India penetration level, and far below the penetration levels in South and East 
India. This is a fact that has been corroborated by the company, although they have 
not provided specific numbers.  

We believe this difference in geographic penetration levels is largely on account of the 
following two reasons:  

  Culturally, North and West India are milk strong regions where supply is not 

constrained. Thus, habitually people are milk drinkers and have never felt the need 
to use the aid of an additive.  

  Also, South and East India have traditionally felt the need to use milk additives to 

enrich the nutrient content in milk which has been of poorer quality in these markets.  

Thus, we believe there is a significant market in North and West India the company 
can tap over the next few years. The market potential also depends on availability of 
milk and milk products in the region, as well as consumption habits of the consumer in 
these regions.  

We do acknowledge that driving penetration levels in these milk-strong markets could 
be difficult, as it entails changing consumer preferences. However, the company has 
mentioned in the past about the “2/10 and 4/12 matrix” which it feels will drive 
penetration and consumption over the next few years. Simplified, the strategy is:   

2 out of 10 customers buy Horlicks and consume it in 4 out of 12 months.  

This is the near- to medium-term target for the company and also its stage-I strategy of 
driving penetration and usage levels higher over the longer term.  

Consolidated market – core brand Horlicks has no competition 

GSK Consumer has a dominant 70% share in the malted beverage market, and 
competition is not very strong, with the closest competitor, Cadbury India, only having 
20% share. Additionally Cadbury India has also been actively pursuing the ‘chocolate 
flavour’ market, where it competes with GSK’s Boost brand. However, the core 
Horlicks brand in its standard flavour has no real competition in the marketplace. This 
gives company the opportunity to drive its advantage home and increase share.  

The results of GSK Consumer’s advantage was reflected when Nestlé’s brand Milo 
exited the market in 2009. The chocolate-based malt drink Milo had ~7% share when it 
decided to exit. This market share was split between Cadbury’s Bournvita and GSK 
Consumer’s Boost.

Smaller packs to drive growth  

GSK Consumer has also undertaken other initiatives in order to make the malted 
beverage product more relevant in semi-urban and rural areas. It has launched its 
products in smaller SKUs, which makes it more affordable for consumers. With rising 
consumer incomes in the rural areas helped by increasing wages and other 
government initiatives, we believe the rural consumer is one of the most important 
segments for FMCG companies. Smaller SKUs helps to introduce these consumers to 
the product (acquire new consumers) and make it more affordable for the consumer to 
try the product (increase consumption). The success of smaller SKUs in other 
categories such as chocolates, shampoo and soaps in the past makes us confident 
that this will also lead to success in the malt-based drinks segment. 

Recent diversification successful  

The company has used Horlicks’ strong brand equity with consumers to branch out 
into different categories under the same umbrella brand. Brand extensions such as 
Junior Horlicks (for kids), Women Horlicks (for mothers) and Horlicks lite in the malted 
beverage space have all been successful. The core Horlicks brand is now worth 
Rs13bn. However, if we add the value of the other Horlicks brand extensions which 
are in themselves worth more than Rs3bn, then we have a brand worth Rs16bn, on 
our estimates.  

We believe this strategy of driving new consumers into the category by targeting 
specific sets of consumers has yielded very good results. While the company 
continues to benefit from the growth in the core Horlicks brand, this strategy will help it 
to also develop extensions that will be worth a significant amount over the next few 
years, in our view.

Conclusion: what growth are we building into our numbers?  

For the malt-based food segment, we are building in 11% volume growth in the 
segment over the next couple of years. The company has delivered an average of 
12% volume growth over the past three years, and our estimates assume a marginal 
slowdown over the next couple of years.

In terms of realization, company has achieved pricing of 6% over the past three years. 
GSK Consumers’ products have high brand equity and lack any credible competition, 
and hence in an inflationary scenario, the company has found it reasonably easy to 
pass on additional costs to consumers. Volume growth has continued to be strong, 
which signifies low price elasticity of demand, unlike other consumer products. We are 
building in average pricing growth of 8% pa over the next couple of years. Our 
assumptions work out to average revenue growth 21% pa over the next couple of 
years.  

Biscuits a strong pillar of growth 
Biscuits are the second-largest category for the company, contributing Rs771mn, or 
3.8% to revenues in CY09. This category is also one of the fastest-growing segments, 
clearly growing well above the industry growth rate for biscuits over the last couple of 
years. We expect the category to continue to maintain a growth trajectory of 25%+ 
over the next couple of years, driven primarily by new product introductions. This 
strong growth over the next few years will mean contribution from biscuits category 
could reach ~5% by CY13F, by our estimates. We also expect profitability in the 
segment to improve as contributions from the cookies and creams categories increase 
over the next few years.  

GSK’s still a marginal player…  

The total biscuits segment in Indian is worth Rs123bn (source: Biscuit Manufacturers 
Association of India) and GSK Consumer has less than 1% share in this market. 
Britannia and Parle each have cornered a third of the market, with ITC having a ~10% 
share. GSK Consumer’s brand Horlicks operates in the glucose category, although the 
company plans to launch other categories of biscuits and reduce the share of glucose 
over time. Margins for glucose biscuits are significantly lower than for the other 
categories.

…a lot of headroom to grow share   

We believe GSK Consumer’s brands are well positioned with consumers (particularly 
Horlicks) and it has the opportunity to grow revenues well above the industry growth 
rate. This will be helped by the following, in our view:  

  First, company has over the past couple of years become fairly aggressive in 
launching new products and targeting newer segments. GSK has launched a 
number of new products in the category such as Horlicks Lite, Horlicks Cream and 
Horlicks Cookies over the past three years.

  Second, the market is dominated by two players, Britannia and Parle – both of 

which have a third of the market. With competition increasing from smaller players, 
we expect the industry picture to look more fragmented over the next five years, 
although the larger players should continue to grow. This is an attractive 
opportunity for Horlicks to capture some incremental share away from the leaders.  

  Third, some of the players in the market with 4-5% share, such as Anmol and 

Priyagold, do not have a national presence or a brand big enough to rival Horlicks. 
The company’s renewed focus on the category will mean that these brands could 
potentially lose share to Horlicks over the next few years.  

Increased focus already yielding results 

Since CY08, as the company increased its focus on the biscuits segment, growth 
momentum has picked up significantly, with the company growing its biscuits division 
in terms of value well ahead of the industry. GSK Consumer has realized the 
importance of growing its biscuits segment, which, in our view, provides two benefits 

  Presence in an attractive category 

  ‘De-risking’ of the business model away from the malted beverage segment. 

The company’s growth trajectory has moved significantly higher from the 13% (CY04-
06) range to 25% (CY08-10F).  

We expect this momentum to continue over the next few years, as company now has 
established brands in various segments of the market.

… and entry into cookies segment will be further positive 

The company entered the cookies market in India in 2H10. This is the fastest-growing 
sub segment within the biscuits segment in India. The total market for premium 
cookies is estimated by the company at Rs7.5bn, or 7% of the overall biscuits market.  
Competitors are Unibic India, Britannia and Parle. Competition is getting stronger in 
this segment with the entry of other players such as ITC into the segment. However, 
despite the strong competition in the segment, it is also a very attractive opportunity, 
with an industry sales growth rate of 20%, ahead of the growth for the overall biscuits 
segment.

Medium-term growth ahead of industry 

These initiatives from the company will mean a medium-term growth rate ahead of the 
industry in the biscuits segment, in our view. We estimate that over the medium term, 
the company can grow its biscuits segment by over 20% annually in volume terms, 
which is ahead of the industry. We believe this will translate into the company gaining 
a substantial incremental share of the growing biscuits market over the next few years.  

Horlicks has two decades of experience in the industry 

Horlicks biscuits were first launched in 1992. GSK Consumer has been in the biscuits 
business for a large part of the past two decades. The company has seen the industry 
move through various phases, and the Horlicks brand has survived those periods and 
still is one of the most recognisable brands in India.  

Early part of the decade marked by industry slowdown… 

The biscuits category saw robust growth for most of 1990s as the company’s Horlicks 
brand connected with consumers across the country. However, from the turn of the 
millennium, until 2004, the biscuits segment saw a turbulent period. This was partly an 
industry-wide issue, as annual growth for the industry declined 3.5% in 2000-01, 
mainly due to a 100% hike in the Central Excise Duty (from 9% to 16%). Industry 
production numbers also took a hit, and with rainfall less than average in 2002-03, 
FMCG sector growth slowed to the low single digits. Biscuits as a category were also 
hit hard during this time, with the company’s volumes down 15% y-y in CY02 and flat 
in CY03.   

… and company-specific issues 

In addition to industry wide issues in the early part of the decade, there were certain 
company-specific issues that also led to growth being modest. Some of those were: 

Company’s product mix was less robust 

One reason for the relatively unsuccessful period in the early part of the decade was 
the company’s product mix. The biscuits category only consisted of the Horlicks brand 
in Standard and Elaichi flavours. This meant that while the product offerings across the 
segment went up with competitors launching various products in other segments such 
as creams and cookies, GSK Consumer still only had the basic Horlicks biscuit brand 
with which to compete. This led to the company’s biscuits business growing much 
slower than its competitors.  

Concentration in less profitable segment  

Horlicks brand was present in the glucose segment of the market, which was 
dominated by two of the other big players, Britannia and Parle. The typical product 
(100gm) was sold for Rs4, and with raw material prices on the rise and the need for 
investment behind A&P to grow the market and the brand, segment profitability took a 
hit.  

Competitors realized that they needed to improve the product mix in the segment to 
improve profitability. This led to a slew of product launches in the creams, cookies and 
other more profitable segments across the industry. Since GSK Consumer did not 
adopt this strategy and enter these other segments, its profitability also took a hit, 
which meant less funds available to support the base Horlicks brand.  

Increased competition 

Biscuit industry competition also increased significantly, as existing players launched 
products across various sub segments and new players such as ITC entered the 
market. This led to an increase in A&P spending across the sector, putting profitability 
under pressure, particularly in the basic glucose segment.

Robust recovery 

The industry took a few years to recover from this and it is only since 2004 that a 
robust recovery set in. From 2004 to 2006, the company saw robust growth in the 
biscuits segment, with volume growth averaging more than 13% pa. This was a phase 
of high growth for the industry, as well. However, it wasn’t until CY08 that the biscuits 
segment really took off for the company.  

What are we building in for CY11F and CY12F 

We believe the company will be able to grow above the market growth rate over the 
next few years, and are building in average volume growth of 20% and realisation of 
5% each year. This does not take into consideration any upside from entry into the 
cookies segment, where profitability is higher and the market is growing faster than the 
overall biscuits category.

Instant noodles has had instant success 

Instant noodles – another attractive 
category 
Instant noodles are one of the most attractive and fastest-growing category in India’s 
FMCG space over the past few years. The total noodles category is worth ~Rs17bn, of 
which instant noodles is ~70%, or Rs11.9bn (source: AC Nielsen). The instant noodles 
segment has been growing at an18% CAGR over the past five years. Even in terms of 
size of the segment, instant noodles are one of the largest segments across the food 
space in India.

Consumer acceptance is key in food segment 

We believe consumer acceptance is the determinant of success in the food segment. 
The instant noodles category was launched in India in 1982-83 by Nestlé under the 
Maggi brand. Over the past three decades, the category has seen consumer 
acceptance grow across the country. From first being a product largely only relevant in 
urban India, it has now found acceptance even among rural consumers. Nestle first 
launched its original ‘2 minute Maggi noodles,’ and since then there have been various 
innovations that have made the product more relevant to a larger audience both in the 
urban and consumer markets. This is a significant advantage to new entrants in the 
market, as consumers are well educated about the product and have an acceptance of 
it as well as the value proposition it presents.  

Attractive market with a dominant market leader 

The instant noodles market in India is dominated by Nestle’s Maggi brand, which has 
more than 70% share. The market is growing at more than 18-20% and this makes it 
an attractive opportunity. However market continues to be dominated by Nestlé’s 
Maggi brand and the opportunity for newer players to grow share is attractive.  

This opportunity has attracted several new players into the market recently. ITC 
(Sunfeast brand), Hindustan Unilever (Knorr Soupy Noodles) and GSK Consumer 
(Foodles) have all entered the market in the past year or so. Adding to the mix are the 
private-label brands of major retailers such as Pantaloon, Aditya Birla Retail and Tata 
Star Bazaar, making the market quite crowded.

Healthy variants launched across the board 

The new competitors also realised that to make a meaningful dent in the market and 
challenge the market leader, they needed to come up with products which offered 
consumers a different proposition. This led to the new launches being positioned as a 
niche category within the instant noodles space. For instance, Hindustan Unilever 
launched its noodles which combines with soup (Soupy Noodles), GSK Consumer 
launched its noodles with minerals mixed in (Foodles), and Nestle itself launched 
variants of the Maggi brand such as ‘atta noodles’ made from wheat, and multigrain 
noodles made from a combination of various grains. The one common feature across 
most of the recent launches is that they have all been launched on the health platform. 
We believe this segment will grow much faster than the plain noodles segment in a few 
years’ time.   

Instant noodles has had instant success 

GSK Consumer entered the instant noodles segment in India at the end of CY09. The 
company launched its product under the Horlicks umbrella brand and called it 
‘Foodles’ – a healthy variety of noodles. This has met with instant success, with the 
company able to garner revenues of Rs280m in the first nine months of operations. 
This translates to ~3% market share within the first year of launch on a pan India basis. 
We believe this will continue to be a strong growth pillar for the company as instant 
noodles as a category continues to grow. The opportunity to grow market share is still 
largely ahead, and with Horlicks’ strong brand equity, we believe GSK Consumer’s 
instant noodles business will continue to grow at an above-market rate in the medium 
term. 

What are we building in 

For the instant noodles category, which is growing at 20% per year in sales terms over 
the past two years, according to the company, we expect the company to outgrow the 
market from a low base. We are building in 30% volume growth and for price/mix to 
grow by ~6-7% over CY11-13F. We believe this is realistic, as the company’s 
successful launch in CY10 demonstrates consumer acceptance of the product.  

New launches to improve growth 

The company has over the past year been very active in launching new products, with 
a view to grow the business at a fast clip. We believe these new launches will enable 
GSK Consumer to supplement its fast growth in the malted beverage space over the 
medium term.

Horlicks Asha still in test marketing phase 

The company launched Horlicks Asha – a low-priced variant of the base Horlicks 
brand — in CY2010. It is still in the test marketing phase in some rural areas in India, 
and if the results are satisfactory, the company plans to roll it our nationally over the 
next year. Asha is priced at Rs85 for a 500-gram pouch pack, at a significant 37% 
discount to a Horlicks pack of similar size. There is also a 200-gram pack that costs 
Rs50. The company has taken up this initiative to make the Horlicks brand more 
accessible to consumers in rural areas. We believe with rural incomes continuing to 
rise, and aspiration levels rising as well, smaller SKUs or lower-priced variants of 
successful brands can be very successful. We would cite the example of Dairy Milk 
shots, a smaller variant of Dairy Milk chocolate from Cadbury India, which has been a 
great success in the rural areas since its launch.  

Launch of products in niche categories 

The company has over the past year launched a number of products in niche 
categories such as health supplements, nutrition bars and sports drinks. These 
categories are very small currently in India, but are established and quickly growing 
categories in developed markets elsewhere.  

We believe there is a growing market for these products in major cities in India, and 
company stands to benefit from having the first-mover advantage in these segments, 
in our view. Competitive intensity in these segments is relatively lower, and as these 
categories get bigger over the next few years, the company has an opportunity to 
establish a strong presence. Remember, margins for these products are also relatively 
higher, which should help the company improve profitability.  

GSK Consumer launched the Nutribar cereal bar in February 2009 as a product that 
offers nutrition and convenience to the urban consumer. Although the category is small, 
it is growing strongly, and the company expects to take a significant market share over 
the next few years. Management has targeted sales of ~Rs1.0-1.5bn over the next five 
years in this category. Competition comes from General Mills (Nature Valley brand) 
and Naturell (Rite Bite brand).

Feedback from conference call 

4Q10 result highlights 
  Sales were +21% y-y and PAT was +58%, helped by double-digit growth in the 
core Horlicks and Boost brands. All the subcategories within the Horlicks brand 
recorded double-digit growth as well, with the Boost brand having one of its best 
years with sales +25% in Q4. The biscuits segment saw sales growth of 71%, 
helped by the launch of cookies and cream variants. 

  Volumes growth momentum remained strong across segments, with blended 

volume growth of 15% and price/mix benefit of 7% in 4Q10. 

  Exports remained flat due to a slowdown in Sri Lanka.  

  Margins improved by 230bps y-y, but were down 400bps q-q. This is in line with 

historical Q4 trends.  

  On input costs, milk and milk powder prices were +17% in Q4 with wheat prices +2-
3% and malted barley prices flat. This led to overall input cost inflation of 7.5% in 
4Q10. 

FY10 result highlights 
  Strong momentum in FY10: The company saw strong momentum across all 

segments in FY10, with a particularly strong start to its instant noodles business 
and significant improvement in the biscuits category. The core malted beverage 
category also saw above-average growth.  

  Noodles have been a success: The company’s foray into the instant noodles 

category with the Foodles brand was very successful, with company having a 3% 
share of the market across India. Results in East and South India, where the 
company launched the product initially, were better, with company gaining a 6% 
share in those markets.  

  Biscuits performance strong: Biscuits segment performance was strong, with 
sales +30% for FY10, helped by the launch of the cookies and creams segment. 
The core Horlicks biscuits continue to perform well. 

  Exports weaker: Exports growth was weaker, with some slowdown seen in 
markets such as Sri Lanka. For FY10, exports were +17% vs +20% in FY09. 

  Input costs inflation: The company saw 7.5% blended input cost inflation for FY10. 
Milk and milk powder saw an average of 15-16% inflation and malted barley saw 2-
3% deflation for FY10. 

  Price increases: The company has been able to pass on price hikes of 10% to 
offset this, with the latest hike of 5% being taken during Q4 in the core Horlicks 
brand. GSK Consumer has also increased prices in the Horlicks brand extensions 
over the past month or so, and this should ease the pressure of cost inflation on 
margins, in our view.  

  Market share gains: The company has been able to hold its market share in the 
core Horlicks brand at 53%. Boost has seen a 1.0-1.5% market share gain, and is 
now at 15%. The Viva and Maltova brands have 2-3% share of the market. Overall, 
market share improved by 1% due to improvement in Boost market share.

Outlook for FY11 
  Core segment momentum strong: The company expects momentum to remain 
strong in the core malted beverage segment, with growth expected to improve as 
focus on North and West India increases. The company expects medium-term 
volume growth of 9-10% in the core malted beverage space, with 4-5% pricing 
growth. It has been operating at a much higher level over the past few years, and 
continuing momentum at this level would mean volume growth in the range of 12-
13%.  

  Noodles to grow strongly: Management expects the noodles segment to continue 
to grow at well above the market growth rate over the next couple of years and for 
share gains to be significant over the medium term. The company is targeting 
market share of 15% over the next three-year period, which would mean a 
significantly higher growth trajectory vs the overall market for instant noodles. 
Although FY10 performance has been strong so far in the segment, it has been 
short of the company’s internal targets, but this is on account of supply-side 
constraints and not demand issues. The company expects this to be fixed soon.  

  Focus on biscuits: GSK Consumer has continued to increase its focus on the 

biscuits segment in FY10 and will continue to focus on increasing its distribution 
reach over the next few years. The biscuits opportunity continues to be an exciting 
opportunity, valued at Rs123bn and growing at 20-25%, according to management. 
The company also seen margins improving over the medium term as its share of 
the cookies and creams segment increases. However, competition in the segment 
remains strong, which could mean near-term margins will remain stable as 
company invests behind A&P.  

  De-risking strategy: Management plans to take its share of biscuits and noodles 
to ~15 of sales over the next three years. This will mean that biscuits and noodles 
grow much faster than the market and the company continues to maintain share in 
the core malted beverage segment. We believe these targets are aggressive, and 
our implied growth forecasts in the biscuits and noodles segments are much lower 
vs company expectations.  

  Input cost inflation: Company sees 8.0-8.5% blended input cost inflation in FY11. 
It plans to offset this by cost-savings measures as well as some calibrated price 
hikes across categories.  

  Payout ratio could increase: GSK Consumer management believes that the 
payout ratio could increase further in FY11, but this will depend on business 
performance and the M&A opportunities the company plans to pursue over the next 
year or so. Average payout ratio has been 35% over the past few years, which 
could rise in FY11.

History  

 “GSK's journey began with Horlicks. In the early years, Horlicks, manufactured by 
Horlicks Limited, Slough, England, was being imported, bottled and sold in India. The 
year 1955 saw a change in import policy, following which the import of Horlicks was 
stopped.  

In 1956-57, a team from Horlicks Limited visited India to explore the possibilities of 
setting up a plant. With the support of the then Maharaja of Nabha, His Highness 
Pratap Singh, a plant was set up at Nabha, in Punjab. Thus was born on October 30, 
1958, Hindustan Milkfood Manufacturers Pvt. Ltd., promoted by Horlicks Ltd.  

In the year 1969, Beecham plc., acquired Horlicks Limited and became the majority 
shareholder in Hindustan Milkfood Manufacturers Limited. Ten years later in 1979, 
Beecham India (Pvt) Ltd. merged with Hindustan Milkfood Manufacturers Limited and 
the non-resident equity shareholding was reduced to 40%. The name of the company 
was also changed to HMM Limited, in 1991.  

Beecham plc, UK and SmithKline, USA merged in 1989 to form SmithKline Beecham 
plc, with its registered office in the UK. HMM Limited thus became part of SmithKline 
Beecham Consumer Brands, one of the three sectors of SmithKline Beecham and its 
name was changed to SmithKline Beecham Consumer Brands Limited.  

Yet another christening took place in March 1994 when the name of the Company was 
changed to SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare Limited, reasserting the 
Company's promise of providing healthcare to consumers.  

The plan to form GlaxoSmithKline was announced in London on January 17, 2000. It 
was on December 27 that the two global giants SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo 
Wellcome merged to form GSK. The company’s new identity, GSKCH, has been 
created to reflect our shared values towards scientific research and improving people's 
lives. “

highest and most stringent global manufacturing practices in the industry. Set up at a 
cost of Rs252 crores, the beauty of the factory is in its automated design that allows 
the final product to be produced hygienically and completely untouched by human 
hands. Fully operational, the plant will have the capacity to produce 26,100 tons of

into the segment has been very strong, with a national rollout the products still some 
way off. The noodles product, called ‘Foodles,’ has been positioned on the healthy 
noodles platform and under the Horlicks umbrella brand. This has meant consumers 
have been more willing to try it, out as the brand recall for the Horlicks is very high. ”

 Action  
  We are upgrading our rating on Nestlé India from Reduce to NEUTRAL as the 

Closing price on 16 Feb

Price target

recent correction in the share price (Nestle -11.7% vs FMCG index -10.8%), has 
meant stock is now nearer fair value levels, in our view. While valuations are still 
expensive at 26x CY12F, we believe Nestle is an attractive long-term story in the 
Indian food sector.  

 Catalysts 

Input cost environment remains volatile, which is negative, while continued focus 
on innovations will likely support strong revenue growth and margin improvement.  

 Anchor themes 

Food remains a strong opportunity in urban India; Nestlé India is one of the most 
attractive plays on this theme, with a strong market share in milk & milk products, 
confectionery and chocolates. Potential to leverage off the parent’s portfolio should 
help it deliver above-average revenue/earnings growth in the medium term.

 Turning more positive, but limited upside 

The recent correction in the share price (Nestle -11.7% vs FMCG 
index -10.8%), has meant the stock is now nearer fair value levels, in 
our view. While we believe the longer-term opportunity is attractive, 
current valuations at 26x CY12F mean we would wait for a better 
entry point. 

 Long-term play on urban consumption  

The company operates in the fast-growing, yet under-penetrated 
processed food opportunity in India, and hence, we believe the 
sustainability of earnings is significantly higher than at hygiene and 
personal care (HPC) names. We believe Nestle is an attractive play 
on the longer term growth of the processed foods space in urban India, 
however, due to valuations we are NEUTRAL.  

 Rising input costs a short-term concern 

Rising input costs are a cause for concern in the short term, as milk 
and sugar prices have been rising. The company has taken some 
price hikes to offset the pressure on margins, but could see some 
short-term risk to earnings over the next couple of quarters.  

 Maintain estimates and target price; move to NEUTRAL 
We are keeping our estimates and target price unchanged and are 
turning more positive tactically on the back of the recent correction. 
However, with the stock trading at 26x CY12F, we believe there is 
limited upside from current levels. We value the stock at 27x average 
CY12F earnings which is in line with the long-term average trading 
multiple for the stock.

Drilling down 

Leadership across various segments 

Through innovation, the company has established itself as the market leader across 
various popular FMCG categories in India. Apart from the well-known positions in 
instant noodles, the company also has leadership positions in the dairy & coffee 
segments.

Ability to handle competition puts Nestle on a strong wicket 

While the company has been able to demonstrate its category-building skills over the 
years, what makes this more compelling, in our view, is Nestlé’s ability to maintain this 
leadership over time. One of the best demonstrations of this is in the instant noodles 
category where it has consistently beaten the competition, despite many players 
entering the fray. Hindustan Unilever has been trying to establish itself in the category 
since the mid 1990s, but has not been able to build a sustainable presence. The 
current opportunity in the category is ~INR11.9bn as per AC Nielsen, and growing at 
18-20% per annum. The medium-term opportunity continues to remain strong in the 
category with penetration levels still low in rural India.  

The company has been actively looking to build on its leadership positions with 
innovations across the urban and rural markets. In the urban markets, the company 
has looked to position the brand as a healthy option along with convenience with the 
‘Maggi atta noodles’. To tap the potential growth in rural areas, the company has 
launched new smaller packs, which should help it target more households in the 
medium term.

We would also highlight that the company has over the last two months implemented 
aggressive price hikes in the chocolate portfolio and milk products portfolio, in both the 
core milk category and the dairy category. This aggressive pricing strategy, despite 
increased competition, underlines the company’s strong brand franchise and 
leadership, in our view.

Presence in a fast-emerging category to help sustain growth in 
the longer term  

One of the biggest advantages that Nestle India’s has over its competitors, in our view, 
is its very strong presence in the biggest, yet one of the fastest-growing segments of 
the consumer sector. Processed food is a US$4bn category (the biggest in terms of 
size) in India, and has been growing steadily at 12-15% p.a. over the past few years 
(amongst the fastest in the sector).  

The key thing to keep in mind is that processed foods as a category are a strong play 
on urban consumption, and would be one of the key beneficiaries of rising income 
levels and increasing urbanization trends, in our view. Hence, we believe there is little 
doubt over the sustainability of the growth for the category from a long-term 
perspective. Nestle has a strong presence in the category and we expect the company 
to be one of the main beneficiaries of the upcoming strong growth.

Strong in terms of innovation capabilities 

The company has a strong track record of being able to bring innovation through to the 
market place. It first did this when it established the instant noodles market in India in 
the 1980s; since then, it has expanded into a number of categories where it has grown 
the market, along with maintaining its number one position. While milk products and 
nutrition continue to be a major contributor to the company, other categories have 
emerged in recent years, such as beverages, along with innovations in prepared 
dishes and cooking aids and chocolate and confectionery which have helped the 
company to consistently deliver strong earnings growth.  

Parent has a big portfolio to bring into India 

Nestlé India’s parent company has a strong portfolio of products across the food and 
confectionery space which it could leverage. The company has recently said that it 
plans to enter the breakfast cereals category in India with brands such as Chocapic, 
Cookie Crisp and Cheerios. The company has already introduced its ice cream brands 
Mövenpick and Haagen-Dazs through the modern retail formats. The Economic Times 
reported on March 10, 2010 that the company may bring its popular weight 
management programme, Jenny Craig, to India. The opportunity to leverage the 
parent’s large portfolio remains an attractive option, which gives Nestle India the 
opportunity to enter and grow categories in the medium term, in our view. We believe 
the company will look to expand its presence in India; introducing new products will 
help revenue growth in the medium term. In this regard, we believe the medium-term 
revenue growth opportunity is one of the most attractive across the FMCG sector.

Valuations 

Stock has underperformed so far this year 
The stock has been an underperformer YTD, underperforming the consumer index and 
Sensex by 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. This is partly due to high valuations as well as 
on concerns of rising input cost environment negatively impacting profitability.

Premium valuations for higher & sustainable growth  
Nestle India trades at 26x CY12F earnings. Although this is higher than the sector 
average of 23.5x, we believe this is justified for two reasons. 

  Nestle also offers a strong 23% earnings CAGR over the next two years, according 

to our estimates, which is much higher than the sector average. 

  Current valuation is in line with its own long-term average valuation.

Earnings and target price unchanged  
We have not changed our earnings estimates or target price. We believe Nestle will be 
able to deliver more than a 22% earnings CAGR over CY10-CY12F, despite some 
concerns around rising input cost prices. The company has strong pricing power which 
should help mitigate some of the margin pressures over the next few quarters.  

Long-term attraction remain  
Over the longer term, we prefer the food space in India vs. HPC, and Nestle is one of 
the most attractive opportunities. However, we see stock as fairly valued at current 
levels offering only 4% upside to our target price of INR3,525.

 Action  
  While ITC is the market leader in the Indian tobacco space, its foray into FMCG, 
particularly foods, will be a key medium-term growth driver, in our view. The 
company has been able to build strong positions in completely new businesses 
such as soaps, packaged staples and snacks over the past few years. This adds 
another strong leg to the medium-term growth prospects for ITC.  

 Catalysts 
  Reducing losses in existing FMCG categories and success in new categories such 

as noodles and pasta will drive company profitability and earnings higher.  

 Anchor themes 

As consumer awareness and income levels improve, we expect more people to 
shift to cigarettes from traditional forms of tobacco consumption. Additionally other 
businesses such as FMCG, Retail and Hotels will be longer-term growth drivers.

Key financials & valuations
31 Mar (Rsm n)

FY10 FY11F FY12F FY13F

 ITC a major player in the food business 

ITC is already a well-established brand in the food space in India with 
a presence across segments such as packaged staples, finger snacks, 
biscuits and packaged foods. ITC’s food portfolio has (end-FY10) 
attained a size of US$600mn and accounts for 9% of the company’s 
consolidated revenues. 

 Packaged and processed food the next growth driver  
The company has, over the past few years, invested significantly in 
expanding its food business portfolio and the related supply chain. 
This has helped create a strong backbone on which we expect the 
company to deliver strong earnings growth in the medium term. 

 Focus on growth and profitability  

While the company’s focus has been on expanding the FMCG 
business, it has also maintained that growth will not be at the expense 
of profitability. Losses in the FMCG business have declined steadily 
and the company expects to breakeven sometime in FY13F. 

 Risk-reward favourable, maintain BUY  

ITC is trading at 21.1x FY12F vs. a sector average of 23.5x. We are 
BUY on the stock because ITC offers strong earnings growth over the 
next two years and the recent correction offers a good entry point, in 
our view. In the short term the cigarette business will deliver strong 
earnings and cash flows, while longer term we expect the food 
business contribution to steadily increase. Profitability of the food 
business will also increase as the need for new investments in the 
business reduces.

Drilling down 

ITC a dominant player in the tobacco space  

ITC’s is one of India’s oldest and by far the biggest player in the cigarette market. The 
company commands a strong 70% market share and is more than 5x the size of its 
nearest competitor (source: company data). 

Along the lines of other global markets, the regulatory environment in India remains 
tough on all tobacco companies. The government targets tobacco consumption 
through taxation and non-tax regulations in a relentless manner. Over the next few 
years, we believe regulations will tighten further. This makes ITC’s incumbent 
advantage even stronger, in our view.  

We foresee ITC maintaining its stronghold in the domestic cigarette sector as it 
continues to build on the strength of its brands and its extensive distribution network.

Strong growth with improvement in margins 

Over the past eight years, ITC’s cigarette business has delivered 11% sales CAGR; 
importantly, this growth has been on improvement in margins. This has meant the 
division’s profits have increased by a CAGR of 15% over the same time period.

The cigarette business profitability has also seen a marked improvement. Operating 
margins have improved from 21.1% in 2002 to 28.2% in 2010. This has been helped 
by: 

  Strong pricing power: ITC has been able to make significant price hikes over the 
past few years, which have partly helped offset the rise in excise duties and have 
also helped improve profitability.  

  Mix improvement: Over the past few years, ITC’s consumers have traded up to 
more expensive brands in its portfolio, which has improved its margin profile. 

Strong cash generation; helps invest in diversification 

The cigarette business generates considerable cash, which has allowed the company 
to invest successfully in expanding other businesses. Our analysis shows that the 
cigarette business has generated US$5bn of operating cash flow for ITC in the past 
eight years. This strong cash generation has been one of the major strengths of the 
company, helping them to successfully diversify into newer businesses.  

Non-cigarette business: focus on growth and profitability 

ITC realises that longer term, growth in the cigarette business is going to be an issue, 
with growth slowing, and hence has consistently made an effort to diversify into newer 
business. It has built some strong brands in areas such as hotels, paper and agri-
products. Its latest endeavour is to expand the non-cigarette FMCG business, ie, food, 
HPC (Hygiene and Personal Care) and retailing. This strong focus has resulted in 
revenues from the business registering a 67% CAGR in the past eight years (from 
2002 to 2010) and today accounts for ~15% of the company’s revenues.  

While the profitability of the cigarette business gives ITC the financial leeway to invest 
in other businesses, we believe the company has also concentrated on further 
increasing the profitability of its non-cigarettes business. Losses in the non-cigarette 
FMCG business have been decreasing steadily over the past few years. The company 
reiterated with its 3Q FY11 results that losses will decrease by 20% each year over the 
next couple of years and breakeven could be some time in FY13F.

FMCG business across food and HPC 

ITC is already a well-established brand in the food space in India with presence across 
segments such as packaged staples, finger snacks, biscuits and packaged foods. 
ITC’s food portfolio has (at end-FY10) attained a size of US$600mn and accounts for 
9% of the company’s consolidated revenues.

Over the past few years, ITC has made an effort to succeed in the food business and 
some of the enabling factors, in our view, have been:  

  Distribution build out: This was one of ITC’s biggest disadvantages when it first 
ventured into the food business. The firm’s non-cigarette distribution network was 
non-existent. It has taken a sustained effort on the company’s part to master this 
chain, a process which started off with its Aashirvad aata (packaged wheat flour) 
product offering.  

  Consumer activation: One of the company’s hallmarks has been its ability to build 
up a credible market share in completely new categories. This has been achieved 
chiefly because of sustained investment in consumer awareness and education. 
The best example of this is its Bingo range of potato chips, which garnered a strong 
No.2 position in the market in the first year of launch itself.  

  Sourcing advantage: ITC has an extremely strong supply chain, which enables it 
to maintain tight control over the supply of inputs for the food business. The E-
chaupal initiative has been pivotal in the success of the packaged staples business 
as well as other food businesses, enabling ITC to not only maintain control over 
quality but also cost of products.  

  Strong R&D capabilities: One of the company’s strengths has been a strong 

focus on innovation. When Bingo was first launched in India, ITC realised it would 
not be able to compete with PepsiCo on the plain salted variety of potato chips. 
Hence, it simultaneously launched several local flavours for each region, thus 
creating a niche for itself.  

A brief look at ITC’s foods businesses  
  Staples: ITC’s brand in the packaged atta (wheat flour) segment has been very 

successful over the past few years. Even after strong growth in the past few years, 
packaged atta is only ~3% of the total atta market. Hence, the opportunity to move 
consumers from loose to packaged atta is large. We see modern retail as a catalyst 
for this move over the next few years; this should add to revenue growth for this 
business in the medium term. ITC has now extended the Aashirwad brand to 
packaged salt and launched multi grain variants of the wheat flour. These brand 
extensions will help extend the offering to a wider consumer base, in our view.  

  Snacks: ITC has been spending significantly to establish a strong presence in the 
branded snacks category (source: company). In this segment, ITC is competing 
with market-leader PepsiCo and has been able to establish a 12-13% market share, 
which it continues to expand. Profitability should improve as ITC gains scale by 
increasing market share. Although the market for salty snacks remains competitive, 
ITC has been able to establish a strong presence and we expect it to be one of the 
stronger players in the category over the medium term.  

  Biscuits: ITC has a strong 10% market share in the biscuits segment and its 

brands have performed well over the past couple of years. It is now looking at mix 
improvement by reducing the share of glucose biscuits (source: company). 
Together with some benefits of scale, ITC expects to improve margins in the 

Nomura

ITC 

Manish Jain

segment over the next year or so. This is a very attractive market valued at 
Rs123bn (in 2010) and growing at 15% (source: Biscuit Manufacturers Association 
of India), and ITC’s Sunfeast brand now has an established presence in the 
segment.  

  Pasta and Noodles: Recently the company forayed into pastas and instant 

noodles under the Sunfeast brand. Both these categories are growing strongly and 
as with other segments in which the company has invested, we expect ITC to be a 
serious player in the segment in the medium term.  

Success in HPC space a solid platform 

We believe ITC’s success in the HPC space, particularly in soaps and shampoo, 
indicates that they are in the business for the longer term and will continue to invest 
heavily in the short term with a view to becoming a significant player. Expanding soaps 
category market share from 0% to 5% within a year of launch gives enough evidence 
that the company has the right people working towards expanding the business, in our 
view, and we expect success to continue into other segments both in the HPC space 
(skin care) as well as food space (Noodles and Pasta). 

Management feedback on the food business 
  Competition in the foods category to increase: Foods remains one of the best 
opportunities across the consumer space over the next few years. However, this 
will also mean competition will be very tough, with many new entrants coming into 
the category.  

  Input costs a concern: Input cost prices for food will remain volatile, but the longer 
term trend is certainly moving higher. At present, the industry might be considering 
ways of handling the volatility, but longer term the concern will be handling 
structural input cost inflation. Nestle, the market leader in many of the food 
segments, recently echoed the same view and some companies realise the 
importance of longer-term structural increase in food prices. This is on account of 
dwindling food supplies worldwide with increasing urbanisation.  

  Modern trade key to success: Growth of modern trade will be a key factor for the 
success of the FMCG industry over the next few years. This is especially true for 
urban areas, where penetration of modern trade is much faster. Modern trade will 
have to be seen as part of the ‘delivery process,’ which starts with conceptualising 
a product to actual delivery to the consumer. Modern trade profitability is low at 
present, but going forward as it becomes more important to the delivery process, its 
profitability will also grow.  

  Cycles getting smaller: Trends in the FMCG sector will probably move much 
faster than many other sectors going forward. This will mean product cycles 
shortening and companies having to constantly improvise so their products suit 
changing consumer needs and preferences.  

  Change in consumer demand: As India’s income has increased over the past 2-3 
decades, the FMCG needs of the consumer have also changed. In the 1970s the 
Indian consumer was largely looking for basic food, and this meant the focus was 
only on staples. In the 1980s and 1990s with incomes moving up, the consumer 
started to look at options that offered convenience along with value for money. This 
was the period for products such as instant noodles, which have today become a 
large segment on their own. Since 2000, focus has shifted further to ready to eat 
products and the trend has been moving towards premiumisation. This is likely to 
continue over the medium term, as growing urbanisation means the consumer has 
less time to devote to cooking. The challenge going forward is to create new 
categories and develop new options at an affordable cost to help the consumer 
make the choice the move up.

Valuations  

ITC is trading at 21.1x FY12F vs. a sector average of 23.5x. We are BUY on the stock 
because ITC offers strong earnings growth over the next two years and the recent 
correction offers a good entry point, in our view.  

Valuation methodology 

We value ITC using a Sum of the parts based valuation methodology. We value the 
core cigarettes business at INR149 per share based on a P/E multiple of 22x FY11F 
earnings. The other core businesses are valued at around INR44 per share. We have 
valued the net cash (after deducting corporate expenses) at book value.  

Risks to our estimates and price target come from regulatory changes in the tobacco 
sector.

 Action  
  QSR Brands’ expansion remains on track in India, where we see relative under-
penetration presenting scope for long-term upside by FY12F, supported by 
continued stability in its home market of Malaysia. But, near-term headwinds of 
rising raw materials costs look set to limit upside for the time being, with soy and 
corn prices approaching 2008 highs. Downgrading to NEUTRAL from Buy, after a 
strong 42% gain and 27% outperformance since July 2010 on slower margin 
expansion and, as a result, lowering earnings by ~7% in FY11F-12F. 

 Catalysts 

1) Continued store openings in Malaysia and India; 2) sustained positive consumer 
sentiment; and 3) confidence in robust economic recoveries across the region. 

 Anchor themes 

Fast-food operators such as QSR are likely to benefit from young populations and 
rising incomes across a diversified geographical base in ASEAN and India.

Nomura vs consensus 

We pare earnings a clip below 
consensus on our muted outlook 
amid rising costs (and 1pp cut in 
margins) despite remaining positive 
on top-line growth and India 
potential.  

On track, but with near-term cost 
pressures 

 India expansion remains the next growth driver 

The December acquisition of two KFC stores in Pune kick-started 
QSR’s consolidation of its ownership of KFC stores in the state of 
Maharasthra. KFC stores remain relatively under-penetrated, and we 
believe QSR will continue to acquire Yum!-owned restaurants in 
2011F whilst organically expanding deeper into the Mumbai metro 
area. Yum!’s focus on growing the China market should provide scope 
for QSR to penetrate further into India from its base in Maharasthra 
over the coming years, we believe.  

 Rising raw material costs limit near-term upside 

While we expect its bulk procurement strategy to remain intact and its 
pricing power to be relatively robust amid captive demand and high 
consumer confidence in its major home market of Malaysia 
(geographically contributing nearly 80% of the top line), QSR’s near-
term margin expansion and upside will likely be capped by rising cost 
pressures. This is in line with our Asian strategy team’s view on rising 
soft commodity prices and declining stock to consumption ratios. 

 Earnings pared by 7-11%; downgrading to NEUTRAL 
Mirroring the more conservative outlook on the cost side, we revise 
down our net margin assumptions by an average of 1pp, largely to 
reflect the 2008 scenario of raw material cost spikes, which implies an 
across-the-board lowering of earnings by 7-11% for FY10F-12F. 
Following a strong share price gain of 42% and outperformance of 
27% since July 2010, we downgrade our call a notch to NEUTRAL 
ahead of the FY10F results release next week, in line with our more 
muted immediate-term outlook and as it continues 2011 execution. 
We remain positive on its long-term growth fundamentals.

QSR Brands Berhad 

Jacinda Loh

Still positive on long-term exponential growth from India 

India expansion remains next growth 
driver 
As of January 2011, QSR operates eight stores in Maharasthra, comprising three in 
Pune, one in Aurangabad and four in Mumbai. The recent release of FY10 results at 
Yum! Brands Inc. reaffirms the positive direction of QSR’s future involvement in India, 
in our view, given the former’s plans to continue re-franchising its company-owned 
restaurants to focus on what it sees as high-growth, high-return businesses — namely 
China, with same-store sales growth of 8% y-y in 2010, which contributes more to 
operating profit than all other countries under the Yum! International division combined. 
This supports QSR’s consolidation in India, as Yum!’s five restaurants in Mumbai will 
potentially be transferred over to QSR in the near term, as discussed in our 8 February, 
2011 report (http://www.nomura.com/research/getpub.aspx?pid=417790). 

India expansion remains on track, 
with the Yum! Brands’ results and 
continued re-franchising strategy 
ex-China supporting QSR’s foray 
into India 

India was one of the top 10 emerging markets for Yum! Restaurants International (ie, 
the overseas division), registering sales growth of 39% on 21% store expansion (the 
highest among emerging markets) in FY10.  

India is one of the top-10 
emerging markets for Yum! 
Restaurants International

Bulk procurement strategy 
(implying relatively stronger 
purchasing power) to limit 
downside risk to margins, we 
believe…  

…but, less scope for margin 
expansion with feed inputs (soy, 
corn) closing in on 2008 peaks

But, immediate near term may see rising raw material prices 

Rising raw material costs limit near-term 
upside 
As discussed in our 21 July, 2010, report, Lickin’ good in India and ASEAN, QSR 
negotiates bulk procurement contracts for most of its food inputs (eg, cheese) under 
Yum!’s global procurement strategy, while chicken feed inputs are obtained on a bulk 
purchase basis with other Malaysia buyers. 

Based on recent USDA reports highlighting falling stock-to-consumption ratios for most 
soft commodities (ie, corn and soy) and our bullish house view on soft commodity 
prices (as per Nomura Chief Asia Strategist Sean Darby, 19 January, 2011, Asia’s soft 
commodity crunch (XXIII) (http://www.nomura.com/research/getpub.aspx?pid=413028), 
we expect lower margin upside momentum despite maintaining store growth 
assumptions of close to 10% for FY10-12F.

For the past three years, average price hikes for KFC products have been in the range 
of 3-5% (generally slightly outpacing inflation), and a sharp weakening in pricing power 
or resistance to price hikes is unlikely, in our view, given wide acceptance of KFC 
products (reflected in its leading market share in Malaysia of 46% in 2009, according 
to a Euromonitor International report dated 13-Oct-2009) coupled with rising incomes 
and buoyant consumer sentiment in Malaysia.  

As such, our revised margin assumptions are largely based on a 2008-type scenario, 
where margin contraction was within a c. 1pp range.  

Pricing power remains fair, given 
robust demand and consumer 
sentiment in Malaysia, which 
contributes nearly 80% of 
earnings

With our downward margin revision, we pare our earnings forecasts for FY10-12F by 
7-11% (ahead of the FY10F results announcement scheduled for 21 Feb), as we 
expect a rising cost outlook to potentially mute any margin expansion.  

We impute the earnings impact of 
higher forward expenditure on 
expansions in the last quarter and 
rising costs potentially muting 
margin expansions, ahead of the 
FY10F results next week

Long-term positive, but near-term upside muted  

NEUTRAL on muted near-term upside; 
although long-term fundamentals intact 
After a c. 42% increase in its share price since July 2010 (outperforming the KLCI by 
27%), we expect QSR’s share price performance to take a breather as the company 
continues delivering on its expansion plans amid a muted cost outlook.  

We remain positive on the expansion (and timeline), given the company’s solid 37-year 
experience in the Malaysian market, as well as the positive growth over the longer-
term from its foray into India. Our SOTP valuation methodology for QSR remains 
unchanged, valuing the rest of the business (ie, ex-India) at c. 12x earnings, average 
of its -1SD and mean level of 15x.

We continue to derive our PT from the average of our FY11-12F FV/share, given that 
we expect the growth from India to become meaningful from FY12F onwards. Based 
on our revised estimates, our new PT is RM5.84 (was RM6.12).

Risks to our price target 

Downside risks to our PT include: 1) non-renewal of the franchise licence with Yum! 
after the 10+10 year contract period; 2) deteriorating domestic consumer confidence 
on worries of a double dip in QSR’s key markets; and 3) fewer-than-expected store 
openings. Upside risks include: 1) store opening growth greater than our assumption 
of c10% pa overall.

 Action  
  Although recent volume growth momentum has been a positive surprise, continued 

Closing price on 16 Feb

Price target

margin pressure and tough comps over the next couple of quarters remain a 
concern for us. Despite the recent correction, valuations are rich at 24.6x FY12F. 
We would sell into strength at these levels. Maintain REDUCE with unchanged TP 
of Rs222.  
 Catalysts 
  We believe the company’s focus on regaining lost market share will keep A&P 
spending high and pricing power low, which could hurt margins in FY12.  

 Anchor themes 

HUVR has a dominant position across various categories in the FMCG space, but 
is now facing intense pressure from global and local players, which, we believe, will 
hold back earnings growth in FY12F.

Prefer food names in the sector 

Key financials & valuations
31 Mar (Rsm n)

FY10 FY11F FY12F

 Prefer food names within India consumer 

As we have said in main section of this report, we believe the longer 
term attractions in food far outweigh the HPC space in India. The 
company’s focus in the near term will continue to remain in the HPC 
space, which we believe will see a structural decline in profitability 
over the medium term. We prefer investment in food names such as 
Jubilant Foodworks and GSK Consumer (both BUY) and Nestlé India 
(NEUTRAL).  

 Margin pressure to intensify 

Q3FY11 was the fourth consecutive quarter of EBITDA & PAT decline. 
The company has really felt the heat of rising competition and 
increase in commodity prices. Despite recent price hikes, we believe 
the situation will continue to worsen. This remains the primary cause 
for concern for us.  

 Volume growth unlikely to sustain  

Given the high base of Q4FY10 and H1FY11 and recent fill reductions, 
we believe that volume growth is unlikely to sustain. Amongst the 
business, performance of body wash and personal products remains 
a cause of concern as there could be a structural decline in 
profitability.  

 Valuations expensive, maintain REDUCE 

YTD, Hindustan Unilever has underperformed the Sensex and FMCG 
index by 0.8% and 1% respectively. The stock trades at 24.6x FY12F, 
which translates into a PEG of 3x (vs a sector average of 1.2x) and 
offers negative incremental risk-reward, we think. We continue to 
remain negative on the stock given that pressure on profitability is 
likely to intensify over the next couple of quarters. Maintain REDUCE.

Hindustan Unilever

Business update 

Amongst the worst performing stocks in 
the consumer space 
After an extremely strong run in the H2CY10, Hindustan Unilever has been one of the 
worst performing stocks in our consumer coverage YTDCY11. The stock has corrected 
in excess of 16% since early January, thereby underperforming the consumer index 
and Sensex by 1.3% and 2.6% respectively. We think some of the triggers for this 
outperformance have been: 

  Rising commodity prices which are likely to put further pressure on the company’s 

profitability.  

  Competitive intensity continues to remain high and thus rising advertising spends 
would keep operating margins under pressure. Further, with the Cricket world cup 
just round the corner, we believe that the stakes are likely to rise further.  

  The stock had run up in H2CY10 on the back of defensive buying interest and 

expectation of improvement in performance.

However, valuations still look expensive 

However, despite the steep correction, valuation continues to remain expensive on a 
relative basis. At CMP, the stock trades at a P/E multiple of 24.6x FY12F earnings, 
which is a 5% premium to the sector average. We believe HUVR should trade at a 
reasonable discount to the sector average as it offers one of the lowest earnings 
growth profile. We believe current valuations are building in significant improvement in 
profitability into FY12F, which we see as unlikely. On a PEG basis HUVR trades at 3x 
vs. the sector average nearer 1.2x.

Even on a premium/discount to Sensex basis, the stock has seen the premium 
increase significantly over the last 4-5 months on the back of no significant 
improvement in operational performance. We believe that the current premium of 60% 
to Sensex will also shrink over the near to medium term as earnings keep 
disappointing.

Margins under pressure… 
As we have said in the past, margin volatility has been on account of the company 
trying to balance volume growth vs. profitability, which they unfortunately have been 
unsuccessful in. They have either delivered on strong volume growth performance like 
the past few quarters, or have delivered on high margins at the expense of volume 
growth like in FY10.  

Margins in Q3FY11 were down 360bps y-y to 12.4%, amongst the lowest level in the 
last nine quarters. Incidentally this is the fourth straight quarter of EBITDA decline for 
the company. This is a cause for serious concern, in our view.  

The going from here is going to get even tougher as Q4FY11 & Q1FY12 face tough 
comps even in terms of volumes, and we would expect weakness in margins to worsen 
as commodity prices increase.  

EBITDA margins have continued 
to remain under pressure

...led by a sharp fall in personal products 

Personal products business, which contributes about 32% to total company sales & 
65% of the profits, witnessed a margins decline of 310bps y-y. This we believe is the 
biggest cause of concern. The thing to note is that operating margins in personal 
products portfolio at 28.8% are now the lowest witnessed in Oct-Dec quarter in the last 
8 years for HUL.  

This is on the back of continuing promotions in the shampoo segment which have 
taken a toll on profitability. Also, things continue to be tough in the oral care segment 
where they have been consistently losing share and have recently upped the ante in 
terms of promotions.   

Things we believe are going to worsen here, given the entry of ITC in the skin care 
segment (which is the highest margin business for HUL).  

This used to be one of the highly profitable businesses within the HUVR portfolio a few 
years back, but has seen a steady long-term decline in margins as competition from 
both national and MNC players have eaten into the company’s profitability. With 
competition expected to remain tough in the near to medium term, margins in this 
segment will continue to remain under pressure.

Going to get tough now 

One of the things which the Street seems to be excited about has been the robust 
volume growth. While we do acknowledge that it has been a surprise, we believe what 
has helped the company has been: a) weak comps from last year, b) increase fill 
levels due to the on going price wars, and c) inventory build up at the dealer level.  

However, we believe the current growth momentum is likely to be tough to maintain 
given that the comps will now get progressively tougher (Q4FY10: 11% and 
Q1FY11:11%). This we believe is something to watch out for.

Input prices continue to harden 

Input prices have continued to harden over the past few months. Although the 
company has made some price hikes, this is only to partly offset these rising input 
costs. The company did acknowledge that only a part of the rise in input costs has 
been passed on to consumers. This has led to margins continuing to remain under 
pressure and company will need more prices hikes in the coming quarters to offset this. 
However, this could mean a negative impact on volume growth.

No changes to TP & earnings estimates 

We have not made any changes to our target prices or earnings estimates. Our target 
price of Rs222 is based on 20x FY12F multiple of Rs11.2.  

Conclusion 

We continue to remain negative on the stock given that profitability increasingly keeps 
coming under pressure. Rising commodity costs and higher advertising spends are 
likely to bring margins under pressure. Moreover, what makes risk-reward 
unfavourable is valuations, which look rich at 24.6x FY12F. We believe the food sector 
is a much better play on the long term consumption story and would advise investors 
to switch to Jubilant foodworks and GSK Consumer. Maintain REDUCE.  

Upside risks 

Upside risks to our numbers could come from a sharp drop in input prices as well as 
from a marked slowdown in the competitive environment in the sector. However, we do 
not believe either of these scenarios will pan out in the near term.

STOCKS 
Stock recommendations are based on absolute valuation upside (downside), which is defined as (Fair Value - Current Price)/Current Price, 
subject to limited management discretion. In most cases, the Fair Value will equal the analyst's assessment of the current intrinsic fair value of 
the stock using an appropriate valuation methodology such as Discounted Cash Flow or Multiple analysis etc. However, if the analyst doesn't 
think the market will revalue the stock over the specified time horizon due to a lack of events or catalysts, then the fair value may differ from the 
intrinsic fair value. In most cases, therefore, our recommendation is an assessment of the difference between current market price and our 
estimate of current intrinsic fair value. Recommendations are set with a 6-12 month horizon unless specified otherwise. Accordingly, within this 
horizon, price volatility may cause the actual upside or downside based on the prevailing market price to differ from the upside or downside 
implied by the recommendation. 
A 'Strong buy' recommendation indicates that upside is more than 20%. 
A 'Buy' recommendation indicates that upside is between 10% and 20%. 
A 'Neutral' recommendation indicates that upside or downside is less than 10%. 
A 'Reduce' recommendation indicates that downside is between 10% and 20%. 
A 'Sell' recommendation indicates that downside is more than 20%. 

SECTORS 
A 'Bullish' rating means most stocks in the sector have (or the weighted average recommendation of the stocks under coverage is) a positive 
absolute recommendation. 
A 'Neutral' rating means most stocks in the sector have (or the weighted average recommendation of the stocks under coverage is) a neutral 
absolute recommendation. 
A 'Bearish' rating means most stocks in the sector have (or the weighted average recommendation of the stocks under coverage is) a negative 
absolute recommendation.
