PwC’s analytics
solutions for the
FMCG sector
Strictly private
and confidential

Overview
Indian consumers are changing at a faster pace than expected. Today,
FMCG manufacturers rely on consumers ‘pulling’ products through the
supply chain; thus, they require a better understanding of consumer
behaviour and choices. Consumers are well-informed about product
information—in particular, promotions and price comparisons via
the Internet—which makes predicting behaviour very complex. This
is where business analytics plays a very important role, as it allows
organisations to derive predictive insights to enable competitive factbased decisions. Armed with deeper insights into consumer behaviour,
FMCG manufacturers will be able to direct R&D investment, improve
the effectiveness of marketing and maximise supply chain efficiencies.
Let’s look at a few scenarios where analytics plays a crucial role in
solving the challenges encountered by FMCG companies.
