Winning in an era of
unprecedented disruption:
A perspective on US retail
In light of the large-scale
forces disrupting the US retail
industry, once-optional moves
have become imperatives.

A new value-creation
model for consumer goods
The industry’s historical
value-creation model
is faltering. Here’s how to
reinvent it.

Agility@Scale: Capturing
growth in the US consumergoods sector
To compete more effectively
in the US market, consumerpackaged-goods companies
must combine greater
agility with new types of
scale advantage.

Reviving grocery retail:
Six imperatives
In the United States and
Western Europe, many
traditional grocery retailers
are seeing their sales and
margins fall—and things
could get even worse. Here’s
how to reverse the trend.

Who’s shopping where?
The power of geospatial
analytics in omnichannel retail
Using advanced geospatial
analytics, retailers can now
quantify the true economic
value of each of their stores
across channels—and they’re
uncovering surprising insights.

From lab to leader: How
consumer companies can
drive growth at scale with
disruptive innovation
In the era of “fast products”
and digital disruption,
delivering growth requires
putting in place new
predictive consumer-growth
capabilities—including
innovation—based on speed,
agility, and scale.

Faster fashion: How to
shorten the apparel calendar
To get new styles into
stores more quickly, fashion
companies must improve
internal collaboration, tap into
consumer insights, and start
to digitize the value chain.

Delivering the goods, on
time and in full
E-commerce giants
have raised the bar for
supply-chain performance.
Now consumer-goods
manufacturers face a
stark choice: achieve new
levels of accuracy and
responsiveness, or pay a
heavy price.

Beyond procurement:
Transforming indirect
spending in retail
If retailers treat indirect costs
as an opportunity for business
transformation rather than just
a procurement matter, they
can boost return on sales by
as much as 2 percent.

‘Fast action’ in fast food:
McDonald’s CFO on why the

working, what’s not, and what’s
next for the iconic brand.

Foreword

A new year is an opportunity for renewal—a fresh start, a time
to recommit to long-standing goals or to pursue new ones, a chance
to get reenergized and build momentum for the year ahead.
Indeed, most of my recent conversations with leaders in the retail
and consumer-goods industries have been about bold plans to
tackle the challenges and make the most of the opportunities that
this year will bring.
As you embark on your 2019 journey, my colleagues and I offer some of our latest thinking on
topics that affect retailers and consumer-goods manufacturers worldwide. We find this to
be a time like no other, as large-scale trends and disruptions fundamentally and systematically
reshape the consumer sector. The articles in this edition of Perspectives on retail and consumer
goods explore how these trends and disruptions are changing our industries, and how successful
companies are responding to—and capitalizing on—these changes. We hope that our research
and analyses will help you gain new insights, find inspired solutions, and learn from the
experiences of others.
Some recurring themes emerge in many of these articles. One is the potential of digitization and
advanced analytics to transform every part of the business. Another is the rising importance
of agility in organizations—the ability to act rapidly on customer feedback, bring solutions to

market quickly, and refine them continuously. Yet another is the crucial role that talent plays in
a company’s success, in a world where certain skills and capabilities are in extremely high demand
but short supply.
Companies neglect these themes at their peril. In every subsector within retail and consumer
goods, we’ve found that the winners are those companies that harness the power of digitization
and analytics, implement agile methodologies, and put talent at the top of the CEO agenda.
We believe that laggards in these areas might get by in the short term but will be vulnerable in the
medium term—and ultimately will struggle to survive.
This edition of Perspectives also features an interview with Kevin Ozan, the CFO of McDonald’s.
As part of the top team at one of the world’s largest restaurant chains, he has firsthand knowledge
of what it takes to turn around a company in decline and steer it toward sustained, profitable growth.
McDonald’s has been one of the most fascinating growth stories in the retail and food-service
industry in the past few years. I hope you find the interview both interesting and instructive.
On behalf of my colleagues at McKinsey, I wish you a happy and prosperous 2019.

Much has been made lately of the “retail apocalypse,”
with headline after headline declaring the demise
of retail as we know it. Yes, store closures have indeed
outpaced store openings across the US market in
recent years. And, yes, retail foot traffic in both mall
stores and stand-alone stores has been, and continues
to be, on a downward trajectory. It’s also true that
the retail landscape is littered with bankruptcies—
upward of 40 in the past two and a half years in North
America alone, with more looming on the horizon.
Yet, at the same time, Amazon and other digital
disruptors had a massive run-up in share in a slew of
retail categories. Brands are getting into the retail
game themselves and going directly to the consumer.
The pace of M&A and private-equity activity in the
sector has quickened in recent months. Perhaps most
telling of all, US retail sales have actually risen: the
2017 total of $3.53 trillion is a 3.9 percent increase
from 2016.
So, is traditional retail dead? Or is it undergoing
a metamorphosis—and more alive than ever?
In our view, the answer is clear: the US retail industry,
far from being moribund, is experiencing disruption—
and reinvention—at unprecedented speed. It’s not
a story about the malaise of an entire sector but rather
a tale of two worlds. A confluence of trends has changed
the playing field, forcing retailers either to adapt and
innovate or to suffer painful losses or imminent demise.
In this new playing field, consumers are promiscuous
in their shopping, easily switching from one brand
or channel to another. Technology not only drives
consumer engagement but also changes the playbook
for retail productivity. Industry boundaries are
blurring: nonretailers are selling to consumers,
while retailers are expanding into adjacent sectors
in pursuit of growth. The war for talent rages on, and
retailers are battling companies both inside and
outside retail to attract the best people. And, of course,

other large-scale risks and uncertainties—new
trade tariffs and cyberthreats, to name just two—are
keeping many a retail CEO up at night.
If there was ever a time to challenge assumptions
and take bold action, it is now. In the face of this
disruption, formerly optional moves have become
“must dos.” Retailers that sit on the fence risk getting
outcompeted by aggressive, fast-moving, forwardthinking competitors.
In this article, we discuss five disruptions and five
imperatives for competing in the retail environment
of the future. While a few retailers may be ahead of
the game in one or more of the imperatives, none are
yet excelling in all of them.

A disruption like no other: Key questions to
ask now
Although many of the trends we discuss have been
evident for several years, the certainty, combination,
and acceleration of these forces have resulted in a
disruption unlike any that retailers have faced before.
This is the new normal.

Are you meeting consumers where they are—
both physically and digitally?
Gone are the days when a retailer could rely on brand
loyalty. Recent surveys have found that millennials
tend to perceive newer brands as better and more
innovative, and that more than 60 percent of Gen Z
consumers are attracted to smaller “new” and “fun”
brands. Many younger consumers, who want brands
to be transparent and approachable, say they distrust
large corporate brand names. Being an older, wellestablished brand name—once a major asset—is now
something of a liability.
Against this backdrop, retailers and consumer
brands must work harder to engage consumers—and
the most effective way to do so is via digital media.

Customer relationships are now digital-centric,
with consumers spending, on average, almost six
hours per day on digital media. Digital channels
continue to be the source of most retail growth and
will soon influence most retail purchases: Forrester
Research estimates that by 2022, e-commerce will
account for 17 percent of total retail sales (ranging,
by category, from 4 percent in grocery to 66 percent
in electronics), while an additional 41 percent will
be digitally influenced offline sales (with digital
channels influencing as much as 30 percent of offline
sales, even in mostly offline categories like grocery).1

automatically. For all retailers, this means having to
ensure a convenient, frictionless shopping experience
both offline and online. A retailer’s accessibility and
relevance are no longer just about physical location but
also about digital presence, whether through mobile
sites and apps (their own or others’) or smart devices in
cars and homes.

Are technology and analytics working for you?

The shift to online sales, coupled with rising labor
costs, puts pressure on store economics. At best, the
economics are break even; at worst, a 5 percent shift
from in store to online can reduce earnings before
interest and taxes (EBIT) by 20 to 30 percent. At the
same time, the “buy online, pick up in store” option,
now offered by many retailers, boosts store traffic.
Retailers must therefore evaluate store economics
within the broader context of omnichannel economics.

Digitization is revolutionizing not just how retailers
engage with consumers but also how they unlock
productivity. Whereas scale was once the primary
lever of cost and efficiency, technology now plays
that role across the value chain. In-store retail
technologies, from handheld devices to sensors,
are improving store processes. Robotic process
automation is speeding up back-office tasks. Retailers
have access to more operational data than ever, can
conduct sophisticated analytics, and can tap into
artificial intelligence (AI) to inform everything from
product design to supply-chain management to
store experience.

Consumers’ embrace of digital media has also
made retail competition more intense: savvy upstart
brands can quickly gain a foothold online, even
bypassing traditional retail channels. E-commerce
platforms, such as Shopify, have enabled value and
luxury brands alike to launch direct-to-consumer
sites without making big investments in tech
capabilities. Smaller brands can market themselves
inexpensively yet effectively on the internet and on
social networks. These innovative brands selling
directly to consumers also further reinforce the idea
that traditional retailers are stale, as they don’t carry
these new brands.

Our research suggests that currently available,
at-scale technology could help automate more
than 55 percent of tasks in a classic grocery store.
This automation would reduce selling, general,
and administrative (SG&A) costs; enhance customer
and employee experience; and free up funds to fuel
growth elsewhere. Furthermore, research from
the McKinsey Global Institute has shown that the
retail industry could reap global benefits from
AI worth $400 billion to $800 billion—more than
any other industry. Such advanced technologies
were once too expensive and unproven, but their
economics now work.

Another effect of digitization: consumers now have skyhigh expectations when it comes to convenience. They’ve
become accustomed to near-instant gratification:
on-demand movies and music, speedy delivery of online
orders, and even smart devices that can purchase items

At the same time, there are dramatic business
implications that retailers will need to grapple with.
For example, with more processes and information
being digitized, cybersecurity becomes ever more
critical. Yet, only 16 percent of global organizations

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

believe their risk-management processes are mature
enough to handle cyberthreats. 2

How will you compete with the nonretailer
retailer?
Many retailers aren’t just retailers anymore—they’ve
expanded into services, healthcare, and other adjacent
sectors. Target acquired delivery-focused companies
Grand Junction and Shipt, CVS Health acquired
health insurer Aetna, and IKEA now owns TaskRabbit.
Conversely, nonretail companies are encroaching
on retailers’ turf. Fitness companies like Peloton are
selling products, such as exercise bikes and athletic
apparel, as well as experiences and technology.

Are you positioned to win the war for talent?
To win in this era of disruption, retailers can no
longer rely on the traditional talent profiles; they
need to hire the would-be disruptors. This means
acquiring new skills, including data science,
software development, and advanced analytics.
And as retailers expand into becoming service and
experience providers, they’ll also need expertise
in new industries.
Finding best-in-class talent is tough, not least
because retailers are competing with direct-toconsumer companies, energetic start-ups, and tech
giants—all of which tend to be more appealing to
the most in-demand talent profiles. Even the hottest
retail brands may not be perceived as desirable

China’s Alibaba, JD.com, and Tencent—and, following
their lead, Amazon—became online juggernauts
precisely by crossing industry boundaries. These
pioneer companies created ecosystems that integrate
marketplaces, services, platforms, and digital content.
In the US market, Amazon is a retailer as well as an
e-marketplace, a web-services provider, a producer of

movies and TV shows, a maker of smart-home devices,
and an online pharmacy, among other things. As these
cross-industry ecosystems capture an ever-larger
share of consumers’ time and attention online, they’ll
easily grab more and more market share.

employers, as they’re tainted by the retail industry’s
reputation of being old fashioned and slow. An
additional challenge for retailers is that talent is
concentrated in the major coastal cities.
Another facet of the war for talent, both at the
front line and in corporate offices, is the potential
displacement and necessary reskilling of retail
workers, driven by the advent of AI and automation.
In our view, this should be the number-one obsession
of chief people officers and heads of HR in retail.
They will need to get ahead of it before competitors,
regulators, or public-opinion shapers force the issue.

Are you prepared for the local impact of
global risks?
With a number of emerging-market companies
experiencing supercharged growth, it’s no surprise that
they’re looking to expand beyond their home countries
and even their home continents. Retailers with global
aspirations—including Alibaba and JD.com—are eyeing
the US market as their next target for expansion.

8

Meanwhile, on the global stage, much remains in flux.
The level of uncertainty and volatility surrounding
global trade is higher than it’s been in recent years,
with new tariffs, changes in several countries’ trade
agreements, new data-privacy rules and regulations,
and geopolitical developments all across the globe.
For most retailers in the Western Hemisphere
engaged in offshore sourcing, geopolitical forces
could fundamentally reshape the P&L.

No longer optional: Key actions to take now
To survive and thrive in the coming decade, retailers
must refashion their businesses to capture the
opportunities presented by the totality of these
trends. For many retailers, it’s now do or die.
Operational discipline will be more critical than
ever, as retailers will need to find funds to fuel
these transformations. Here are five imperatives—
not suggestions—for companies that aim to be
tomorrow’s retail winners.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

Reimagine the store
Since established brand names mean much less
to consumers than they used to, the basis of retail
competition is shifting from price and product
superiority to privileged insights and customer
experience. In light of this shift, there’s no doubt that
physical stores can still be highly effective consumer
touchpoints, but retailers need to think hard about
the role of the store.3 Stores must be tightly integrated
with the online channel, enabling online sales while
simultaneously offering experiential features
and cutting-edge technology that sets the store apart.
Nike does an admirable job of marrying in-person
experiences with digital capabilities in its stores. At
the company’s flagship store in midtown Manhattan,
customers can use the Nike app to reserve products
for pickup, scan QR codes on mannequins to check
for available colors and sizes, pay for merchandise
instantly, and book in-store consultations with Nike
experts. Another New York City store, in the SoHo
neighborhood, boasts athletic environments—such
as a basketball half-court and a treadmill—enhanced
with cameras and digital screens to give shoppers
an immersive experience and real-time feedback.
Because convenience has become increasingly
important to consumers, retailers should deploy
technology that makes shopping easy and seamless.
Food retailer Ahold Delhaize’s no-checkout “tap
to go” technology is one example. Apparel retailer
Everlane allows customers who have registered on
its website to “shop walletless” in its stores. At the

New York and San Francisco stores of the apparel
brand Reformation, customers use digital screens to
select items they want to try on; store associates then
place the items in dressing rooms.

Sweat your tech and analytics spend
Technology and advanced analytics represent
massive opportunity in retail. Advanced analytics
should inform retailers’ decisions across the value
chain—from targeted pricing and promotions
to smarter category management and localized
assortment planning. In back-office functions,
analytics and machine learning can increase
efficiency and effectiveness, reducing cost to fuel
efforts on more strategic priorities.
Personalized marketing, in particular, can
unlock enormous value: retailers have seen sales
uplift of 10 to 30 percent and as much as 5 percent
improvement in customer acquisition. Using
advanced analytics, retailers can monitor customer
“signals”—such as purchases, online browsing, and
social-media posts—which should then trigger
relevant and timely personalized messages. And
retailers shouldn’t wait for perfect systems or
perfect data to get started cultivating real-time
relationships with individual consumers. Although
one-to-one personalization is the goal, even one-tomany is better than no personalization at all.4
There’s much higher scrutiny today, from both inside
and outside companies, on resource allocation and
returns on tech spending, but the right investments

superiority to privileged insights and customer experience.

can pay off handsomely. Retailers that are technology
leaders can generate two to five percentage points
greater EBIT than technology laggards.

Pursue partnerships as a new way to compete

be a reimagination of the retail business model:
for instance, the ecosystem might offer rentals,
subscriptions, ad space, or digital goods, all of which
hold significant potential as new revenue streams
and new ways of reaching customers.

Witnessing the seemingly unstoppable growth of retail
ecosystems like Alibaba and Amazon, traditional
retailers are realizing that they can’t go it alone, because
of both capability gaps and the sheer financial burden
of keeping up with technology cycles. Some retailers
have joined forces with companies in other industries,
allowing them to amass consumer touchpoints, gather
new consumer data and insights, or access capabilities
they couldn’t otherwise afford. Examples include
Kroger partnering with UK-based Ocado to build 20
automated warehouses in the next three years, several
grocers linking up with delivery service Instacart,
and McDonald’s working with Uber Eats to offer food
delivery from thousands of McDonald’s restaurants
around the world.

Because speed is at a premium, agility must become
a way of life for retailers. There are, of course, SG&A
benefits associated with organizations implementing
flatter structures with flexible networks of teams,
but agility is about so much more. Agile companies
are three times faster at going from ideation to
implementation and two times more likely to take
bold risks to transform the customer experience. 5 For
retailers, becoming agile means moving away from
the heavily matrixed organizations and meetingdriven cultures of the past and instead forming small,
cross-functional teams that use “concept sprints” to
design, test, and scale initiatives.6

Retailers should also seek to establish consumer
touchpoints within the large ecosystems: Alibaba,
Amazon, Google, JD.com, and Tencent. For example,
several retailers—including Carrefour, H&M, and
Walmart—have formed partnerships with Google.
(Recognizing their outsize influence, even the
ecosystems themselves are partnering with each other.
Amazon has a storefront on Alibaba’s TMall. Google
and Tencent announced a long-term agreement to
share patents. Tencent has an ownership stake in
JD.com.) Retailers must determine what they bring
to the table in both data and capabilities and how
to integrate such partnerships into their strategy.
If retailers have the cash and capabilities, they could
perhaps create their own ecosystems. Consider
the following scenario: a drugstore chain partners
with a health insurer, a chain of fitness centers,
a physician-referral service, and a health-focused tech
company, like Fitbit. Such an ecosystem would offer
a single, comprehensive network for a consumer’s
health and wellness needs. Part of this strategy should

10

Become an agile, talent-first organization

Just as essential as agility is an organization-wide
emphasis on talent. What does it mean for a retailer
to put talent first?7 Practically, it means coming
up with a new value proposition for attracting and
retaining a new breed of retail employees. It means
looking for candidates in nontraditional places,
including the so-called gig economy, in which 20 to
30 percent of the US working-age population already
participates. Retailers must create a culture for new
talent profiles to succeed in the organization and
offer creative options and approaches (such as virtual
working environments) to support different ways
of working. Some retailers, including Target and
Walmart, have opted to secure needed capabilities
through “acqui-hiring,” or acquiring start-ups
primarily for their talent. Retailers must also
develop strategies for reskilling and retraining the
workforce. 8 Simply put, company leaders must be
convinced of—and then act on—the fact that without
the right people and the right skills, success just
won’t be possible.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

Take a 360-degree view of risk
With disruption comes uncertainty, and retailers
must ensure they can respond rapidly to fast-changing
circumstances. Take the issue of tariffs: if new tariffs
on Chinese imports materialize, a company that is
heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing could suffer
devastating financial consequences. Retailers face
a broad range of other risks as well, including brand
and reputation risk, activist investors, cyberattacks,
and data-privacy breaches. Yet a recent McKinsey
survey of more than 1,100 global companies found that
boards spend less than 10 percent of their time on risk
management—a percentage that hasn’t increased in
the past few years. 9
It’s critical for retailers to cultivate strong riskidentification and risk-management capabilities
and to create and prepare for a variety of scenarios
systematically; taking lessons from the banking
sector could be one idea.10 And retailers must develop
strategies for data protection and digital resilience,
the hallmarks of which include an engaged and aware
frontline staff, differentiated protection for the most
important assets, and active defenses that can be
deployed in real time.11

Retail is in the midst of a disruption like no other,
which is forcing an existential crisis. Every retailer
must decide whether or not to get ahead of the curve
and redefine its strategy and operating model to win in
this era of disruption. Some are taking a wait-and-see
stance; others are moving too cautiously and making
little impact. But there are real costs to waiting
that may never be recoverable. Only by heeding the
imperatives discussed in this article—and acting
with urgency—can retailers position themselves for
a winning future.

A new value-creation model
for consumer goods
The industry’s historical value-creation model is faltering.
Here’s how to reinvent it.
Greg Kelly, Udo Kopka, Jörn Küpper, and Jessica Moulton

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

The fast-moving-consumer-goods (FMCG) industry
has had a long history of generating margin-enhancing
growth. By 2010, the industry had created 23 of the
world’s top 100 brands and had grown total returns
to shareholders (TRS) almost 15 percent a year for
40 years. But the model that fueled industry success
now faces great pressure as consumer behaviors shift
and the channel landscape changes.
To win in the coming decades, FMCG companies
must reduce their reliance on mass brands and offline
mass channels. They must also embrace an agile
operating model focused on brand relevance rather
than synergies.

© Hero Images/Getty Images

The traditional model
FMCG companies owed much of their success to
a five-part model for creating value. Pioneered just
after World War II, the model has seen little change
since then. FMCG companies did the following:
 Perfected mass-market brand building and product
innovation, thus capturing not only reliable
revenue growth but also gross margins typically
25 percent above those of nonbranded players.
 Built relationships with grocers and other mass
retailers that provide advantaged access to
consumers. By partnering on innovation and
in-store execution and tightly aligning their
supply chains, FMCG companies secured broad
distribution as these retailers grew.
 Entered developing markets early and actively
cultivated their categories. Consumers in
developing markets became wealthier and proved
a tremendous source of growth—generating
75 percent of revenue growth in the sector over
the past decade.
 Designed their operating model for consistent
execution and cost reduction. Most FMCG

expenses at 4 to 6 percent of revenue.
 Used M&A to consolidate markets and create
a basis for organic growth postacquisition. After
updating their portfolios with new brands
and categories, FMCG companies applied their
superior distribution and business practices to
grow those brands and categories.

Signs of stagnation
But this long-successful model of value creation has
lost considerable steam. The household-products
subsegment, for example, has dropped from the sixth
most profit-generating subsegment at the start of
the century to the tenth, measured by economic
profit. Food products, long the most challenging
FMCG subsegment, fell from 21st place to 32nd. As
a consequence, FMCG companies’ TRS growth
lagged behind the S&P 500 by three percentage
points from 2012 to 2017. As recently as 2001 to 2008,
their TRS growth beat the S&P by 6 percent a year.
The issue is the lack of organic growth. From 2012
to 2015, the FMCG industry grew organic revenue
at 2.5 percent (net of M&A, foreign-exchange effects,
and inflation), slightly behind global GDP growth.
But companies with more than $8 billion in annual
revenue grew at only 1.5 percent—half the growth rate
of companies with sales of under $2 billion (Exhibit 1).
This difference suggests that large companies face
a serious growth penalty, which they are not making
up for through their minor earnings-before-interestand-taxes (EBIT) expansion.
Organic growth matters in the consumer-goods
industry. FMCG companies that achieve abovemarket revenue growth and margin expansion
generate 1.6 times as much TRS growth as players
that outperform only on margin.

Ten disruptive trends
This FMCG value-creation model stopped generating
growth because of ten technology-driven trends,
most of which are in their infancy but will have
significant impact on the model within the next five
years (Exhibit 2).

1. The millennial effect
A recent McKinsey survey found that millennials are
almost four times more likely than baby boomers to
avoid buying products from “the big food companies.”
And while millennials are obsessed with researching
before buying, they resist marketing and look instead to
learn about brands from one another. They also tend to
believe that newer brands are better or more innovative,
and they prefer not to shop in mass channels.1

14

Furthermore, millennials are much more open to
sharing personal information, allowing “born digital”
challenger brands to target them with more tailored
propositions and with greater marketing-spend
efficiency. Millennials are generally willing to pay for
special things but otherwise seek value. Millennials in
the United States are 9 percent poorer than Gen Xers
were at the same age, so they have much less to spend
and choose carefully what to buy and where to buy it.

2. Digital intimacy (data, mobile, and the Internet
of Things)
The volume of data generated continues to increase,
boosting companies’ capabilities but also consumer
expectations. Most FMCG companies have started
to embrace digital but have far to go, especially in

adopting truly data-driven marketing and sales
practices. Some FMCG categories, particularly
home care, will be revolutionized by the Internet of
Things (IoT)—converting some product needs, like
laundry, into service needs. And in many categories,
the IoT will reshape the consumer decision journey,
especially by facilitating automatic replenishment.2

3. Explosion of small brands
Many small consumer-goods brands are capitalizing
on millennial preferences and digital marketing
to grow rapidly. These brands can be hard to spot

because they are often sold online or in channels not
covered by syndicated data. But venture capitalists
have spotted them: more than 4,000 of them have
received $9.8 billion in venture funding over the past
decade—$7.2 billion of it in the past four years alone
(Exhibit 3).
Retailers have also taken notice of these small
brands. According to Nielsen, US retailers are
giving small brands double their fair share
of new listings. Small brands can be a source of
differentiation for retailers and can help drive

and rarely sell their products at less than full price.
As a consequence, they are capturing two to three
times their fair share of growth while the largest
brands remain flat or in slight decline (Exhibit 4).

4. “Better for you”
For years, consumers have said they want to eat
healthier foods and live healthier lifestyles, but only
recently has their behavior begun to change. Consumers
are redefining what healthy means, eating more fresh
food instead of packaged food, and demanding more
products that are natural, organic, and free from sugar,
gluten, pesticides, and other additives.

Five factors make a category ripe for disruption
by small brands: high margins, strong emotional
engagement, a value chain that is easy to outsource,
low shipment costs as a percent of product value,
and low regulatory barriers. The beauty-products
category fits this profile especially well. In color
cosmetics, born-digital challenger brands already
represent 10 percent of the market and are growing
four times faster than the rest of the segment.

is still in its early days and will only accelerate as the
e-commerce giants expand their geographic reach and
move in to brick-and-mortar locations. Amazon’s push
on private labels is a further game changer.

6. Discounters
In each grocery market discounters enter, they
typically grow to secure market share of 20 percent or
more. Aldi and Lidl have grown at 5.5 percent between
2012 and 2017, and they are looking to the US market
for growth. Discounters lure consumers with their
carefully curated offering of approximately 1,000 fastmoving SKUs sold at prices 20 percent below mass
grocers—and can still generate healthy returns.

7. Mass-merchant squeeze
Together, the seven largest mass retailers saw flat
revenue between 2012 and 2017. This pressure is
forcing mass merchants to become tougher trading
partners: they are pursuing more aggressive
procurement strategies, including participating in
buying alliances; being more vigilant about SKU
proliferation; and decreasing inventory levels. As
mentioned, they are also seeking out smaller FMCG
brands and strengthening their private labels.

will require FMCG companies to update their go-tomarket approaches.

9. Pressure for profit
Driven by activist investors, the market now has higher
expectations for spend transparency and reallocation
of resources. Large FMCG companies are implementing
cost-reduction approaches such as zero-based
budgeting, which typically reduce spend on activities
such as marketing. While effective at increasing
short-term profit, such approaches haven’t yet proved
their ability to generate longer-term winning TRS.

10. Increasing competition for deals
Certain consumer-packaged-goods sectors—such as
over-the-counter drugs—will see greater competition
for deals, as large assets become scarce and privateequity firms provide more and more funding and drive
up valuations. M&A will therefore continue to be an
important capability for growth.

Creating value in a reshaped marketplace
To survive and thrive in the coming decades, FMCG
companies will need a new model for value creation—
consisting of a three-part portfolio strategy as well as
organizational and operational agility (Exhibit 5).

8. The rise of local competitors
Developing markets still have tremendous growth
potential. They are likely to generate new consumer
sales of $11 trillion by 2025, which is the equivalent of
170 P&Gs. Local competitors will fight aggressively
for that business by offering locally relevant products
and acquiring local talent. FMCG companies will
need to respond by moving away from their fairly
centralized decision-making models. Local relevance,
proximity to the consumer, and speed will become
more important drivers of competitive advantage
than consistent execution. Furthermore, channels
in developing markets are evolving differently than
they did in the West: discounter-like formats are
doing well in many markets, and mobile will obviously
continue to play a critical, leapfrogging role. This

18

A broader portfolio strategy
Going forward, FMCG companies will need to sustain
excellence in developed markets, even as they build
the capabilities to leapfrog in developing markets and
to “hothouse” premium niches.

Sustaining excellence in the developedmarket base
FMCG companies must keep the base healthy. The
good news is that the industry keeps advancing
functional excellence through better technology
and, increasingly, use of advanced analytics. The
highest-impact advances we see are in the areas
of revamping media spend, particularly through
programmatic M&A and a deeper understanding of

Companies will need to increase their pace of testing
and adopt a “now, new, next” approach—ensuring that
they have a pipeline of sales-stimulating incremental
innovation (now), efforts trained on breakthrough
innovation (new), and true game changers (next).
Furthermore, they will need to join up their historically
decentralized sales function and overcome channel
conflict. E-commerce must be treated as part of the
core business. Players like Koninklijke Philips that have
weathered the laborious process of harmonizing trade
terms across markets are finding that they can grow
profitably in e-marketplaces.

A new value-creation model for consumer goods

Finally, FMCG companies will need to keep driving
down costs through zero-based budgeting,4 highly
automated “touchless” supply-chain and salesand-operations planning, and advanced analytics
and digital technologies to improve manufacturing
performance (for instance, through predictive
maintenance).5 Many of these changes will require
companies to treat technology as a core competency
rather than a cost center.

Leapfrogging new category creation in
developing markets
FMCG companies must bring their newest and
best innovation, not lower-quality products, into
developing markets early to capture a share of the
$11 trillion potential growth. Success will require
excellent digital execution, as many of these markets
will grow up digital; empowerment of local leadership

19

to make marketing decisions; and a route to market
that is unified across offline and online channels.

Hothousing premium niches
To capitalize on the explosion of small brands, FMCG
companies must identify and cultivate premium
niches that have attractive economics and high growth
potential. They must acquire or build small businesses
and help them reach their full potential through
fit-for-purpose commercialization and distribution.
This means, for example, building a supply chain that
produces small batches and can adapt as companies
learn from consumers. The beauty industries’
incubators are a good model here.

backbone includes clear rights and accountabilities,
expertise, efficient core processes, shared values
and purpose, and the data and technology needed for
a simple, efficient back office.
The agile organization moves fast. Decision and
learning cycles are rapid. Work proceeds in short
iterations rather than in the traditional, long stage-gate
process. Teams use testing and learning to minimize
risk and generate constant product enhancements. The
agile organization employs next-generation technology
to enable collaboration and rapid iteration while
reducing cost.7

M&A as an accelerator
This three-part portfolio strategy calls for an agile
organization. Agility allows a company to adapt to fastchanging circumstances.

An agile organization
Building an agile organization requires abandoning the
traditional command-and-control structure—in which
direction cascades down from leadership to middle
management to the front line—in favor of viewing the
organization as an organism that consists of a network
of semiautonomous teams.6 In this model, the role
of leadership isn’t “order giver,” but rather enabler or
“servant leader.”

M&A will remain critical to FMCG companies as
a way to pivot the portfolio toward growth and
improve market structure. The strongest FMCG
companies will develop the skills of serial acquirers,
becoming adept at acquiring both small and large
assets and at using M&A to achieve strategic
goals—redefining categories, building platforms and
ecosystems, getting to scale quickly, and accessing
technology and data through partnership. These
companies will complement their M&A capability
with integration and scaling capabilities, such
as incubators or accelerators for small players. 8

Moving forward
An agile organization has two essential components:
the dynamic front end and the stable backbone.

To respond to the changing marketplace, FMCG
companies should take the following steps:

The dynamic front end consists of small, crossfunctional teams (“squads”) that work to meet
specific business objectives. The teams meet daily to
prioritize work, allocate tasks, and review progress;
use regular consumer and customer feedback loops;
and coordinate with other teams to accomplish their
shared goals.

 Take stock of your health by category in light of
current and future disruption, and decide how fast
to act. Ask questions about the external market:
How—and how much—are consumers changing?
How well positioned are we to respond to these
changes? What are the scale and trajectory of
competitors that aren’t tracked by syndicated data?
Are our growth and rate of innovation higher than
these competitors’? How advanced are competitors
on making model changes that might represent

The stable backbone provides the capabilities that
agile teams need to achieve their objectives. The

20

competitive disadvantages for us? How healthy
are our channel partners’ business models, and
to what degree are we at risk? Do our future plans
take advantage of growth tailwinds and attractive
niches? Answering these questions creates the
basis for developing scenarios on how rapidly
change will happen and how the current business
model might fare in each scenario.

an ambitious timeline for making the needed

the talent required for successful execution.

FMCG companies should proceed with these efforts
with controlled urgency. They will need to make
ever greater use of the consumer insights, innovation
expertise, and activation capabilities that have led
the industry to success—but companies must wean
themselves away from reliance on the strategies and
capabilities of the traditional value-creation model.
It’s time to adopt a new model.

EXCERPT

Agility@Scale: Capturing growth
in the US consumer-goods sector
To compete more effectively in the US market, consumer-packaged-goods companies must combine
greater agility with new types of scale advantage.
Jan Henrich, Ed Little, Anne Martinez, Kandarp Shah, and Bernardo Sichel

This is an excerpt from “Agility@Scale: Solving the growth challenge in consumer packaged goods,”
which first appeared online in July 2018. To read the full article, visit McKinsey.com.

It’s been a tough few years for large consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) manufacturers in the US market.
Since 2011, the organic-growth rate for CPG companies has declined, with the decline continuing in
2018. CPG companies with material portions of their business in the United States have seen year-overyear organic-growth rates drop to the very low single digits on average. The length and depth of this
decline isn’t something that the sector has experienced over the past 20 years or more, and the drop
contrasts with consumer confidence, which is back up at prerecession levels (Exhibit 1).
Total returns to shareholders (TRS) have underperformed the S&P since 2011. Growth has been a
negative contributor to TRS, and margin expansion only a minor positive contributor.
The sector’s performance is attributable to changing conditions on several fronts. Consumers, channels,
and competition are all different than they were a decade ago, stymieing CPG manufacturers that had
become accustomed to the fairly stable growth brought about by rising consumer demand. And the next
five years will almost certainly bring more change than did the previous five years. Many CPG executives
recognize that they can’t continue to rely on historical growth models, but few have made sufficiently
transformative moves—often, incremental change gets mistaken for transformation.
What will it take to jump-start and sustain profitable growth in the CPG sector? We believe CPG
companies need a new model to drive their businesses—one that combines aspects of scale advantage,
defined in new ways, with greater agility on multiple fronts. We call this model Agility@Scale (Exhibit 2).

The relative importance of each puzzle piece—and how they fit together—will vary by company. In this
excerpt, we focus on the following elements of the model: agile reallocation, Consumer 3.0, and “thinking
broad and small.”
Fuel growth through agile resource reallocation
McKinsey research has shown that companies that are dynamic resource reallocators—meaning, they
reallocate more than 49 percent of their capital over ten years—have achieved much greater TRS growth
over time than their less dynamic peers. Unfortunately, most CPG companies are not very dynamic.
In particular, CPG companies must get better at shifting resources away from unpromising areas and
toward areas of strength with the highest growth potential. Of course, this is easier said than done.
Effective cost-reduction programs are part of the answer. And our research suggests that there is no
significant trade-off between operating-expense efficiency and growth. Indeed, in recent years, some
CPG companies have set a new bar in terms of cost efficiency without a growth penalty relative to
their peers. So, framing cost reduction as a way to invest behind strength and coupling it with a fact-driven,
enterprise-level strategic planning process that rethinks investment levels each year can be a way to
capture TRS benefits.

Deliver next-generation consumer engagement: ‘Consumer 3.0’
In our experience, there is wide variability among CPG companies in how effectively they access and use
the millions of “crumbs” of data available on consumers. In some data spaces, the CPG sector has fallen
behind the retail sector and runs the risk of being at an information disadvantage in the value chain.
The best CPG companies are stitching together disparate data, sometimes in real time, to understand
microsegments of consumers and to build more intimate profiles of consumer behaviors, attitudes, and
needs. These companies are relying less on stated preferences and more on actual behavior. They are
seeking to influence and engage consumers in a world where it is difficult to “own” the message fully
with company-generated content. This “Consumer 3.0” approach stands in contrast to mass marketing
(“Consumer 1.0”) and to digital marketing (“Consumer 2.0”), which relies upon company content and
essentially replicates offline marketing in a more targeted and efficient way.
The potential scale advantage for large CPG companies lies in combining 3.0 approaches with more
traditional 1.0 and 2.0 approaches. They should be complementary, not mutually exclusive. There is
power in the ability to combine the brand awareness and presence associated with these high-reach (and
high-cost) channels with the advanced-analytics– and data-fueled engagement of 3.0 approaches. CPG
companies need a more expansive definition of “share of voice,” one that encompasses brand-owned
content in traditional and digital channels, and the myriad other influence points for consumers. Larger
players can potentially be more effective across this expanded share-of-voice landscape by using spend
advantages in traditional channels along with advanced analytics and data capabilities in new channels.

24

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

Use Agility@Scale to go broader and smaller
One of the advantages of using the Agility@Scale model is the potential to compete across a broader
range of market spaces. The basis for competition becomes a superior organizational and operating
model—one that can translate into new arenas beyond near-in adjacencies. “Adjacency” thinking is, in
some ways, a growth approach rooted in traditional notions of scale, such as capturing synergy because
of manufacturing assets, distribution and customer advantages, and shared selling, general, and
administrative functions.
CPG companies need to think more broadly about where to get growth and to follow the example of
others who compete in new ways. Amazon is an example through its devices, cloud services, marketing
services, entertainment-content development, and omnichannel grocery, among others. Some CPG
companies are pushing the boundaries of their footprints, although not necessarily on the basis of
Agility@Scale. Examples include Mars’s move into veterinary clinics, General Mills jumping into a highgrowth space in pet food, and Nestlé moving further into the vitamins, minerals, and supplements space.
As for “thinking smaller,” the underlying concept is that growth is granular. This notion is nothing new:
finding pockets of growth within larger category and geographic definitions has been a key to growth
for a long while. What’s changing now is both the growing fragmentation of consumer preferences
as well as the availability of data and technology to help companies understand the market landscape
at a micro level. These changes raise the bar on a CPG company’s ability to use data and technology
to market to growth pockets as well as its organizational agility to access them. In this way, the Agility@
Scale operating model enables “thinking smaller,” just as it enables “thinking broader.”

McDonald’s CFO on why the
company is growing again
Kevin Ozan became CFO of McDonald’s in 2015. Since then, the restaurant
chain has had a string of successes. Here’s his take on what’s working, what’s
not, and what’s next for the iconic brand.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

When Kevin Ozan assumed the CFO role in March
2015, McDonald’s was a company that seemed to have
lost its way. Sales were in a prolonged slump, onceloyal customers were going elsewhere, competitors
were eating away at its market share.

But quickly, the top-management team—led by new
CEO Steve Easterbrook (whose first day as CEO was
also Ozan’s first day as CFO)—developed a turnaround
plan, which started showing results within months.
By early 2017, the company was ready to replace its
turnaround plan with a growth strategy.
Fast forward to 2018: Easterbrook, Ozan, and the
rest of the current leadership team have revitalized
the fast-food chain. They’ve turned around a massive
operation—encompassing 37,000-plus locations
in more than 100 countries, with annual revenues
exceeding $20 billion—and set it on a path to strong,
profitable growth. As of late 2018, McDonald’s samestore sales had risen for 13 consecutive quarters.

growth to date, how to sustain it, and his role in making
it all happen.
McKinsey: Not long after you became CFO,
McDonald’s developed a three-part growth framework—
retain, regain, and convert customers. Tell us about
that. What’s worked best? Which of the three is the
most difficult?
Kevin Ozan: Our growth framework came out of
research we conducted in our ten largest markets. It
was the biggest consumer-research effort we’d ever
done in our history. The research showed that what
consumers want and why they come to McDonald’s—
whether they’re in Germany or Japan or the United
States—is much more similar than different. So our
framework is universal; it allows us to speak a common
language across the organization while still allowing
local management to bring it to life for customers in
their markets.

Ozan takes pride in the company’s solid financial
performance, but he knows there’s a lot more work
to do. The 21-year company veteran now oversees
more than 2,000 employees, about half of whom are
in McDonald’s finance departments (accounting,
internal audit, treasury, tax, global business services,
and investor relations). The other half work in either
the technology function or in the company’s global
restaurant operations and development group—two
departments that began reporting to Ozan on January
1, 2019. A Midwesterner who says he eats McDonald’s
food about three times a week (favorite menu item: the
Egg McMuffin), Ozan is candid about the challenges
that the chain continues to face—including recent
declines in US customer traffic, operational hiccups in
its restaurant remodels, and an intensely competitive
talent market.

We’ve been really focused on the “regain” part. Before
we launched the consumer research, we thought
that the reason we were losing some customers
was new trends—people moving away from quickservice restaurants (QSR) into fast-casual or more
upscale dining. But the research told a different
story: we were actually losing customers to our
direct QSR competitors. On the one hand, that was
frustrating because, obviously, we don’t want to lose
to competitors—but on the other hand, we took a lot
of satisfaction from it because we knew we could win
those customers back. Those are people who like
quick-service restaurants and who enjoy eating our
food; we just weren’t giving them what they wanted.
Thanks to the changes we’ve made in enhancing
convenience, introducing new value platforms, and
improving the customer experience, we’re regaining
some of those customer visits.

In November 2018, he spoke with McKinsey senior
partner Greg Kelly at McDonald’s new headquarters
in Chicago. He shared his thoughts on the company’s

“Retain” is about keeping the customers who have
historically been our stronghold— families with young
children and people who love McDonald’s breakfast.

“Convert” is about attracting new people to McDonald’s
by pursuing growth opportunities in places where
we’re not getting our fair share, so that’s areas like
coffee and snacks. It’s probably the hardest of the three.
We’re making progress, especially with our McCafé
proposition and our new specialty coffees.
McKinsey: Let’s talk about the “retain” part. You
could have just left it out of the growth framework, but
you didn’t. How well has that worked?
Kevin Ozan: One of the challenges for big organizations
like ours is to do multiple things successfully at the
same time. I liken it to a kids’ soccer game: wherever the
ball goes, that’s where everybody runs to. In most of

28

the world, our growth framework has helped us fight
that instinct. We’ve continued to build on our strengths
with families and the breakfast daypart. In the US,
we had a bold agenda that required us to execute across
many levers, and we didn’t pay as much attention to
breakfast as we should have. We didn’t advertise and
promote it as much, and we didn’t introduce any new
breakfast products for years. So, in the past couple of
years, we’ve had negative traffic during breakfast hours
in the US market. We’ve learned that we do indeed need
to keep a focus on the “retain” part of our strategy. We
can’t take our strengths for granted. We’re learning how
to keep our eye on the things that are working well even
as we go all in on new areas.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

McKinsey: Speaking of new areas, you’ve added some
elements to the growth framework. You now have three
“growth accelerators”: delivery, digital, and the store
remodels that you’re calling Experience of the Future
(EOTF). How do these accelerators relate to the retainregain-convert framework?
Kevin Ozan: Once we had our baseline growth
framework, as a leadership team we asked ourselves,
“Are we OK with where we are now, or do we have
a greater growth ambition?” We knew we could do
more, so we generated ideas that would help us achieve
more growth. To prioritize the ideas, our primary
screen was what would have the biggest impact on
the most people in the shortest amount of time. That’s
how we came up with our three accelerators.
Delivery is one of them. Steve [Easterbrook] and I
had visited a few countries where we could see that
delivery was clearly a growth opportunity. We wanted
to move faster than what would have been a typical
approach for McDonald’s, so we set up a “fast action”
team—bringing together some of our best talent
from different business units and different regions.
We took them out of their day jobs and had them
focus exclusively on getting into the delivery game
and building momentum as quickly as possible. We
launched McDelivery in three or four months, which,
for McDonald’s, was an incredibly short period of
time; in the past, we would have tested it in one market,
and then another, and maybe rolled it out years later.

We partnered with Uber Eats in most of our markets
because it had the broadest scale across multiple
countries and was in the best position to help us launch,
scale, and grow our delivery business the fastest.
McKinsey: Uber Eats is taking the orders and making
the deliveries, so Uber—not McDonald’s—is getting the
customer data, right?
Kevin Ozan: It’s true that data is a gold mine for
learning more about our customers and giving them
a more personalized experience. If I know that you like
a Big Mac for lunch every Tuesday, for example, we can
tailor our offer to your individual tastes. Right now,
Uber does have the more detailed data on individual
customers. We get summarized data such as time
of day and location. We have a strong partnership with
Uber and are exploring opportunities to share more
information. We’re also integrating delivery into our
mobile app, which will help us gain insights that
will allow us to develop one-on-one relationships with
our customers. That’s the goal.
We knew that McDelivery wasn’t going to be perfect
on day one. But it’s proven to be a highly incremental
business for us. It skews to a younger demographic,
it generates a higher average check, we’re seeing
a high rate of repeat business, and most of the orders
are placed in the evenings, when our restaurants
have more capacity. Now that we’ve launched it, our
focus is on optimizing that business. How do we grow

We wanted to move faster than what would have been a
typical approach for McDonald’s, so we set up a ‘fast action’
team—bringing together some of our best talent from different
business units and different regions.

the app but I still have to line up at the drive-through
and wait for my food, there’s no payoff; I haven’t really
saved myself any time. So we’ve introduced curbside
service: you order and pay through the app, then you
park in a designated parking spot at the restaurant and
the food is brought out to your car. Now there’s a payoff
of added convenience for the customer.

awareness? How do we improve the packaging for
items like fries and drinks? How do we make
our operations more efficient? We’re tackling all of
those things now.
McKinsey: Did you have the same philosophy in
developing your mobile app? Get the app out there and
then improve it as you go?
Kevin Ozan: Yes. Some of our competitors already
had an app, so we wanted to move quickly. If you
think about your apps, you get updates constantly;
consumers are used to that. An app doesn’t have
to have every bell and whistle on day one. Again, that
wasn’t an easy concept for our system given our
historical strength in testing and “fail-proofing”
initiatives before introducing them in our restaurants.
We’re now working on improving the digital experience
for customers. For example, if I order and pay through
30

I see digital as a “greens fee” these days. You need
digital offerings. But ultimately the winners are
going to be the companies that can best integrate
the physical and the digital, and make the overall
customer experience as pleasurable as possible.
That’s what our third accelerator, Experience of the
Future, is about—giving customers more choice in
the way they order, pay, and receive their favorite
food. EOTF has a number of components: one is
modernizing and updating the physical restaurants—
the décor, the seating—another is putting in digital
self-order kiosks, and another is table service. So
whether you’re ordering from the kiosk or the front
counter, you can just sit down, relax, and have the
food brought to you. Table service is a great example
of how we’re trying to increase the level of hospitality
that customers experience in our restaurants.
McKinsey: EOTF is a lot more capital intensive
than the other two accelerators. How did you decide it
was worth the investment?
Kevin Ozan: One advantage of having a large system
like ours is that once we started implementing EOTF
internationally—in places like Australia and Canada—
we consistently saw that it resulted in sales lifts of
roughly 4 to 6 percent, so we knew we were getting good
returns on our investments. We’re spending more than
$1 billion this year on remodeling US restaurants. We’re
trying to do it at a quick pace—about 1,000 restaurants
per quarter—because McDonald’s customers expect
consistency. If you go to one restaurant that’s remodeled,
and then the next day you go to a restaurant down the
street that isn’t, that’s a confusing and disappointing
customer experience.

What we’re seeing in the US is that our remodels
are taking a little longer, partly because the
restaurants are older and need more work. It’s also
taking longer for customers to come back after
a remodeled restaurant reopens. The good news is
that once they do come back, we’re seeing sales lifts
similar to what we saw in international markets.
McKinsey: It sounds like you personally are spending
a lot of time on the various elements of the growth
strategy, rather than on purely financial matters. Is
that just inevitable when you’re the CFO of such
a growth-oriented company?
Kevin Ozan: As a CFO, one of the biggest challenges
is determining where you spend your time. Everybody
wants some of your time, whether that’s the board,
the CEO, employees, franchisees, or suppliers. You’ve
got to spend your time where you can have the biggest
impact. When I became CFO, we were in turnaround
mode, so my time was spent determining the right
cost structure, the right capital structure, how
and where to franchise more—in other words, deep
financial analyses.
As we’ve transitioned into growth, I’m now spending
more of my time on strategy, innovation, IT, and

digital initiatives. I enjoy that. Finance people, just
like everyone else, want to use their creative side;
we want to be strategic business partners rather than
work purely on financial issues.
McKinsey: What’s an example of a time when
either you or your finance colleagues were creative
and helped enable the growth strategy?
Kevin Ozan: Delivery is a great example because
it was a new business model for us. We understood
the profitability of a front-counter and a drivethrough sale, but with delivery, all of a sudden, the
customer has to pay a delivery fee, and there’s
a commission to the delivery provider. It’s a whole
new way of thinking. We’ve had to educate ourselves
and our franchisees that the percentage of
profitability may not be as high as a front-counter
sale, but as long as that business is sufficiently
incremental, it will earn incremental dollars.
So our finance staff has been figuring out the right
financial model for delivery. Are there different
models we can work with our providers on?
What’s the sensitivity of customers to the delivery
fee? Does it matter if we change the split between
the commission and the delivery fee? And so on.

Greg Kelly and Kevin Ozan in one of the outdoor terraces at McDonald’s corporate headquarters in Chicago.

McKinsey: You lead a very large finance organization.
What leadership traits do you look for in your staff?
What traits do you feel have been important in your
own success?
Kevin Ozan: I think CFOs and finance people need
exceptional communication skills. That may not be the
first thing that you’d associate with finance people, but
in my role, I always have to adapt my communication
style and messages to different constituencies—
whether it’s the board of directors, our leadership
team, employees, or franchisees.
Finance leaders need to be able to explain financial
concepts to nonfinancial people. You have to be able
to bring complex ideas down to a level so that everyone
is nodding their head and saying, “I understand what
you’re talking about.” That’s how you get things done
in a large organization.
As a finance team, one of our most important roles is
to produce facts and data, analyze the data, provide
insights to tell a story about what’s happening and why,
and then propose solutions and influence decisions to
help grow the business. I need to ensure that members
of my finance team are focused on that, because it’s not
exactly the way you learn in business school.

32

McKinsey: How do you think you became good at
communication? Did you have to learn it? Or do you think
it was innate?
Kevin Ozan: I learned writing skills in my first job
out of college. I had a mentor who was a strong writer,
and she taught me how to convey my ideas in a logical,
thoughtful manner so that people can easily understand
what I’m saying, whether I’m writing just a short
email or a long memo. Developing those writing skills
also helped me become a better speaker.
Also, my career at McDonald’s has exposed me
to many different perspectives. That has helped me
communicate better with a wide range of people.
I started out in financial reporting, where I gained
a good global perspective of the business from
the corporate side. I then had the opportunity to
work in Sweden, which gave me an international
perspective. I spent some time out in the field
working with franchisees, which was another new
perspective, because franchisees view the business
very differently from the way we did at headquarters.
I came back and went into investor relations, which
gave me an investor and analyst perspective. Gaining
all these different perspectives has been incredibly
valuable in my current job.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

McKinsey: Do you spend a lot of your time on
people issues?
Kevin Ozan: Absolutely, and it’s something I
really enjoy. I spend more time on recruiting, talent
development, and employee engagement than one
might expect. Top talent is scarce and provides a
competitive advantage. Right now we’re in a war for
talent; many of the people we’re trying to hire have
several job offers on the table. That’s true not just at
the corporate office but also in our restaurants. With
unemployment low in many countries, I expect that
talent and labor issues will continue to be a challenge.
We’re investing a lot in upskilling our employees. Our
Archways to Opportunity program, for example, helps
our non-English-speaking restaurant employees
learn English and provides tuition assistance so that
employees can get high-school and college diplomas.
We’ve recently launched a program providing free
career-advising services and tools. We’re investing
$150 million over five years in building the capabilities
of our restaurant employees, so that they can have
great careers whether they choose to stay at McDonald’s
long term or not.

more interesting and rewarding. In our finance
organization, we’re piloting robotic process automation
and other technologies. In our restaurants, we have
a team looking at automation opportunities that can
help drive labor efficiencies.
I’m a big proponent of intellectual curiosity and
agility—learning new areas and keeping up with what’s
going on with the world, whether that’s analytics or
blockchain or something else—and getting things done
quickly. At McDonald’s, we’re more curious than ever,
and we’re getting better at agility. That means our
customers, employees, and franchisees will have lots
of new things to look forward to.

McKinsey: Last question: What’s next for McDonald’s?
What are some things you’re working on that could take
the business to the next level?
Kevin Ozan: We’re constantly reinvesting in our
existing restaurants, of course, because nothing is as
profitable as growing like-for-like sales. But we also
think there’s room for new restaurants, even in
our mature markets, like the US, Canada, and France.
That said, the biggest area of increase in our spending
has been in technology, which is helping to drive
our growth. I expect that will continue. We’re looking
at how to use technology to improve the customer
experience and create new customer experiences. We’re
also exploring technologies that can help us reduce
or eliminate repetitive tasks and make employees’ jobs

Reviving grocery retail:
Six imperatives
In the United States and Western Europe, many traditional grocery retailers
are seeing their sales and margins fall—and things could get even worse. Here’s
how to reverse the trend.

To put it bluntly, much of the $5.7 trillion global
grocery industry is in trouble. Although it has
grown at about 4.5 percent annually over the past
decade, that growth has been highly uneven—and has
masked deeper problems. For grocers in developed
markets, both growth and profitability have been on
a downward trajectory due to higher costs, falling
productivity, and race-to-the-bottom pricing. One
result: a massive decline in publicly listed grocers’
economic value.

and labor costs increased, traditional grocers in
developed markets couldn’t charge higher retail
prices because competition from lower-priced
formats—such as discount chains and dollar
stores—was just too intense. Grocers’ margins fell
dramatically, forcing grocers to sweat their assets.
During that period, more than 50 percent of the
economic profit of large publicly traded grocery
retailers evaporated (Exhibit 1).

What has driven the grocery industry to this point?
The disruption can be attributed to three major
forces: consumers’ changing habits and preferences,
intensifying competition, and new technologies. Each
of these forces is, to some extent, always at work, but
the speed and magnitude of change have caught most
grocers off guard.

This kind of upheaval has made the industry ripe for
a major shakeout. Already, consolidation is on the
rise, especially within countries. M&A activity in
Europe and North America is picking up again after
a dip in 2016, with the recent announcement of the
proposed Sainsbury’s–Asda merger exemplifying
the trend. We believe consolidation will continue
apace—and could eventually spell the demise of all
but the two to four strongest grocery retailers in each
market. These grocers will have to battle it out with
the likes of Walmart, Costco, discounters, and the new
“ecosystems” of Alibaba and Amazon. Grocery chains’
contribution to GDP could decline by $90 billion or
even twice that, depending on the level of automation
(which would reduce retail prices and labor costs) and
the size of the shift toward e-commerce.

These disruptions present considerable—yet
surmountable—challenges. Based on our research
into the global grocery industry, combined with our
extensive experience working with the world’s leading
grocers, we have identified six imperatives for grocers
to win in this rapidly changing environment.

It’s a grim picture. Of course, consumer behavior is
never static, technology is constantly advancing, and
new competitors are always emerging in one form
or another—but the pace and intensity of all three of
these forces have been unparalleled. Very few grocers
have managed to turn these forces to their advantage.

And it could get much worse. Monumental forces are
disrupting the industry. If grocers don’t act, they’ll be
letting $200 billion to $700 billion in revenues shift
to discount, online, and nongrocery channels1 and
putting at risk more than $1 trillion in earnings before
interest and taxes (EBIT).2 When the dust clears, half
of traditional grocery retailers may not be around.

Disruption on three fronts

Changing consumer habits and preferences

In the past decade, sales growth among large grocery
chains in the mature markets of North America
and Western Europe has been a pallid 2 percent
(compared with 9.8 percent in Africa, 8.4 percent in
Eastern Europe and South America, and 6.2 percent
in Asia). Even that 2 percent growth has been hard
won. Between 2012 and 2017, as commodity prices

Consumers today expect to be able to buy almost
anything, anywhere, at any time—and at low prices to
boot. Millennials, which now constitute the largest US
demographic group, have especially high expectations.
In a UK survey of grocery shoppers, millennials said
they seek healthier food choices. They also want to
know exactly where their food comes from and how

it’s made; they expect companies to be socially and
environmentally responsible and to offer sustainable,
traceable products. At the same time, they want
deals and discounts—not surprising, in light of the fact
that they are the first generation that is less wealthy
than their parents. Finally, millennials are drawn to
the seamlessness and convenience of online shopping.
Grocers therefore find themselves in the difficult
position of trying to meet all these expectations
without raising prices.

36

Baby boomers, too, have considerable buying
power and thus are an important customer base
for grocers, but present additional challenges. For
one, baby boomers are different from past elder
generations. They’re retiring later in life; many more
of them are single; many more are comfortable with
technology. They’re more concerned about health and
wellness, they value in-store customer service, and
they’re more open to new products and experiences,
especially those that are unique to their life stage.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

Grocers have to adapt their offering accordingly
while, again, keeping prices low.
One behavioral change common to every demographic
group, including millennials and boomers, has posed
an enormous challenge for the grocery industry: people
are less inclined to cook. Almost half of US millennials
say they rarely prepare meals at home. Across the board,
more consumers are buying ready-made meals. In both
Europe and the United States, food service is growing
faster than food-at-home consumption; in the US
market, food-service revenues already exceed food-athome sales.

Aggressive competitors and the emergence
of ecosystems

Discounters, in particular, came on strong. Schwarz
Group, which owns discounters Lidl and Kaufland,
is now Europe’s largest food retailer. Discounters have
a market share of 20 to 50 percent in Germany, Ireland,
and the Netherlands; ALDI and Lidl are beginning
to flex their muscle in the US market as well. With a
limited assortment and a focus on delivering great value
for each item, discounters maintain higher earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
than supermarkets, but their low prices have reduced
the sector’s overall revenue by about 4 percent.
Low prices are also part of the consumer appeal of
online players like Amazon, which is just getting
started in grocery: its acquisition of Whole Foods

Grocers were slow to adapt to these changes in the
consumer landscape, so other types of retailers quickly
stepped in. Discounters, convenience-store chains,
club stores, dollar stores, and pure-play online retailers

got into the grocery game. Consumer-packagedgoods (CPG) manufacturers began selling directly to
consumers. Food-service players captured the lunch
and dinner occasions.

New technologies
A related (and equally disruptive) trend is the onslaught
of new technologies. The success of Amazon and
other online competitors is due in part to the price
transparency that the digital world has enabled.
To remain competitive, offline retailers have had to
keep prices low even when their costs have risen.
Furthermore, most grocers haven’t deployed cuttingedge technologies—including digital solutions,
advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, robotics,
and the Internet of Things (IoT)—as quickly and
aggressively as their competitors have. For instance,
Amazon’s website features a robust productrecommendation engine powered by advanced
analytics, the company has more than 100,000
robots transporting bins and stacking pallets in its
warehouses, and it has introduced innovations
to make shopping faster and easier, such as its Echo
and Dash devices. Many traditional grocers
find themselves constantly having to play catch-up.

Six imperatives for profitable growth
But all is not lost. Resourceful and nimble grocers
have shown that it’s possible not just to fend off
competitors and hold on to market share but also to
attract new customers and keep them coming back.
Profitable growth is achievable—but it will take
decisive action in each of the following six areas.

1. Define a distinctive value proposition:
Convenience, inspiration, value for money
To hold their own against aggressive competitors,
grocers must build a distinctive offer that emphasizes
one or more of the three value propositions that have
resonated with today’s consumers:
 Ultraconvenience. Convenience is partly about
having store locations that are easy to get to, such
as at train stations or in residential neighborhoods.
But location is only one aspect of convenience.
Retailers should strive to make every part of the

Reviving grocery retail: Six imperatives

shopping experience more convenient, while
maintaining standards of quality far above
typical convenience-store fare. A grocery store’s
assortment might include grab-and-go items,
prepared foods, frozen meals, and loose fruits and
vegetables for shoppers looking for a quick snack.
It might also provide self-service options, express
checkouts, home delivery, and other in-store
services, such as dry cleaning or package pickup.
 Inspiration. A grocer can differentiate itself
by creating an inspiring and exciting shopping
experience that helps customers discover new
products. Some grocery stores now feature digital
signage that offers extensive product information,
including products’ origins and nutritional
properties. Others try to create an environment
that feels like walking through a cookbook, with
fully prepared meals on display or cooked on
the spot, along with recipes and ingredients in
the correct portions. A grocer might decide to
offer a variety of health-and-wellness options,
with an unrivaled assortment of specialty,
organic, and local brands. A mix of education and
entertainment—for instance, cooking classes
taught by a celebrity chef—can also transform
the shopping experience.
 Value for money. This is, obviously, the value
proposition of mass retailers and discounters,
which means competing on this front will be highly
challenging for traditional grocers. To stand a
chance, a grocer would need considerable scale and
a low-cost operating model. Practically, this would
require expertly leveraging big data and analytics,
partnering with other retailers on sourcing, and
dramatically “leaning out” stores, whether through
automation or by adopting a discount-store
model. A more likely path for a traditional grocer
might be to ensure that it’s almost on par with
competitors in value for money, but focus on either
ultraconvenience or inspiration as a differentiator.

39

2. Shape your ecosystem—and either go big or
get out
To stay competitive against the aforementioned
emerging ecosystems, retailers must make big bets
on which battlegrounds to fight in and, subsequently,
which digital and analytics “use cases” to master.
This requires a forward-looking perspective on how
consumer behavior, the competitive landscape, and
technology are likely to change in five years or more.
What are the potential disruptions? What will the
growth areas and profit pools be? Important choices
will revolve around food and nonfood assortments,
payment systems, customer interfaces, service
options, and last-mile delivery.
And going it alone won’t work. To create an ecosystem,
retailers must fill any capability gaps through
partnerships or M&A—for example, by joining forces
with digital, analytics, technology, or convenience
specialists. The goal is to start a virtuous cycle of
using data and analytics to get closer to the customer,
then gathering more data with every customer
interaction—and radically reducing the total costs of
the system by bringing together people, commodities,
and venues.
Let’s look at last-mile delivery as an example. In
online grocery, delivery costs are the biggest hurdle
to profitability (Exhibit 3). It’s a hurdle that can be
overcome only with major investments in advanced
analytics, warehouse relocation, and automation.
If a grocer isn’t willing to go big in e-commerce, it
might as well get out.
Low “drop density” is the main reason for high
delivery costs: a typical delivery-van driver in the
United Kingdom, for instance, makes fewer than five
deliveries per hour on average. Potential solutions
for increasing drop density include a milkman model,
whereby retailers make deliveries to communities
only at specified times each week. A small Dutch

40

grocer, Picnic, has achieved a drop density of
14 deliveries per hour with this model.
Another potential solution is pooled deliveries, which
would require grocers to collaborate with their
competitors or with other businesses: for example,
one player or a third-party logistics provider could
combine several retailers’ deliveries. In China, about
50 companies have been piloting an app that mobilizes
an on-demand pool of thousands of independent
drivers to deliver goods. The app contains profiles
and user ratings of drivers, and it indicates whether
they’re available and willing to help unpack items. To
aid drivers as they navigate neighborhoods, the app
offers detailed trip planners and route maps.3 Early
trials have indicated that this approach could shave
30 percent off retailers’ delivery costs.
Another way to make deliveries cheaper is to store
the goods closer to where people live. According to
our analysis, if a large retailer relocates half of its
distribution centers closer to city centers—from, say,
100 kilometers away to only 10 kilometers away—it
could reduce delivery costs by about 10 percent.
Using drones or fully automated vehicles for a fraction
of deliveries could also reduce costs. But again, these
solutions aren’t cheap. Grocers must decide to take the
plunge into omnichannel retail, or stay out altogether.

3. Put technology to work in every part of the
value chain
The most successful grocers have embraced technology
as the primary driver of commercial effectiveness and
cost reduction across the value chain. Indeed, their use
of technology is what sets grocery leaders apart from
laggards; early adopters are capturing 2 to 5 percent
more in EBIT than slower-moving competitors. Digital
solutions, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence
can have far-reaching impact on customer engagement,
commercial activities, store and warehouse processes,
and back-office operations.

5 Not accounting for cannibalization of offline sales.

Customer engagement
In a recent survey of retail CEOs, 93 percent said
they see personalized marketing as a priority.
Personalization—not just of marketing messages
and offers but also of product recommendations and
content—can yield up to 2 percent top-line impact.
But many traditional grocers have trouble optimizing
their mass promotions. Only a few grocers, such
as Kroger and Loblaws, already personalize their

Reviving grocery retail: Six imperatives

promotions to loyal customers. More-advanced
retailers are working toward “here and now”
personalization efforts, which deliver the right offer
at the right price, right time, and right location.
Commercial effectiveness
Advanced analytics can enable grocers to make
better decisions about assortment, pricing,
and promotions. Already, sophisticated retailers

41

are creating hyperlocalized assortments while
maintaining a centralized merchandising function.
They’re identifying which items play a unique role
in the assortment and conducting space-sensitivity
analysis to determine the best store-specific
planogram. They’re defining price zones using
micromarket segmentation and comparing prices
automatically with key national competitors.
They’re monitoring, evaluating, and tweaking their
promotions daily. And they’re generating insights
that give them negotiating leverage over their suppliers.
In-store and warehouse operations
Up to half of in-store tasks could potentially be
automated. Robots can now answer shoppers’ questions,
suggest items based on a shopper’s previous purchases,
take inventory, keep track of expiration dates, stock
shelves, pick and pack products for delivery, clean up
spills, and even assemble sandwiches and salads. The
partnership between Kroger and Ocado, a leader in
warehouse automation and end-to-end use of advanced
analytics, suggests greater opportunities to offer sameday and same-hour delivery from “dark stores” with
little or no staff. Retailers are testing no-checkout
models: examples include Amazon Go, Ahold Delhaize’s
“tap to go,” and China’s BingoBox, a chain of unstaffed
convenience stores. Since manning checkout registers
represents about 30 percent of store labor—and slow
checkout is among the top pain points for grocery
shoppers—the benefits of redeploying that 30 percent to
higher-complexity tasks would be massive.
Back-office operations
Our experience in other sectors, particularly in
financial services, has shown that digitization of
back-office processes (such as accounts-payable
handling or payroll processing) can yield significant
productivity improvements. We often find that a
majority of back-office processes could potentially
benefit from digitization, which can free up
15 percent or more of employees’ time overall—an
enormous opportunity for grocers.

42

4. Win back lunch and dinner
Grocery stores were once the place where almost
everyone bought their lunch and dinner. In efforts
to reclaim that role, many grocers have expanded
their selection of ready-made meals and prepared
foods. Some are bringing master chefs into the store.
There are several different models for food-service
execution, including having a full-service restaurant
next to the supermarket, dedicating a section of
the store to ready-made meals or in-store dining,
operating a “food hall” that has restaurants as well
as retail shelves, and introducing store-in-store
concepts that focus on niche foods (such as the Sushi
Daily counters inside select Waitrose stores). In
addition, many grocers—recognizing the growing
consumer demand for healthy meals at home—are
finding ways to meet that demand. In China, for
instance, food retailers such as Hema and 7Fresh are
offering home delivery within 30 minutes.
To succeed in food service, grocers must think
through their approach by agreeing on answers to the
following questions:
 Which archetype will we pursue (food for now,
food for later, or both)?
 What store space will we use?
 Who will operate the food-service offering—
in-house staff or a third party?
 What brand will it carry (a store brand, an
existing food-service brand, or an entirely new
brand)?
 Should we offer fast delivery? If so, what’s our
plan for making last-mile delivery work?

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

Some store space could conceivably be reallocated to fulfilling
online orders or providing other services.

Of course, each grocer’s answers to these questions
will depend on a number of variables, including
its particular strengths and weaknesses, the customer
segments it serves, and the local competitive
landscape. In some inner cities, popular food-service
players have a higher density of outlets than the
leading grocers.

are collaborating with property developers and
land owners—entities that have the requisite balance
sheet, capabilities, and relationships with local
authorities. In partnership with these entities, they

6. Innovate ten times faster
Speed is critical, which means grocers must
jettison their traditional—and slow—approach to
implementing new initiatives. They should instead
take an agile approach using “concept sprints.”
Characterized by quick decision making, a focus on
tangible outcomes, constant customer validation,
co-located and multidisciplinary teams, rapid
iteration, and careful attention to internal capability
building, concept sprints can reduce time-to-market
from four to six months to just four weeks.

such an approach to introduce new in-store digital
solutions, refine picking algorithms in warehouses, or
develop new products.

For traditional grocery retailers, a return to
profitable growth won’t happen without tough
decisions and bold moves. The competitors that are
already eating grocers’ lunch (and dinner, too) are
moving quickly, and they’re harnessing the power of
technology to improve operations and relentlessly
pull customers away from traditional grocery
stores. It’s up to grocers to fight back—and perhaps
join forces with one another (within the bounds of
anticompetition and antitrust laws, of course)—to
regain scale and effectively compete in the fastchanging and hotly contested food retail market.

Commercial excellence in China

What does it take to succeed in the fast-changing, wildly competitive Chinese consumer-packagedgoods (CPG) market? Our latest Commercial Excellence Benchmarking yields some answers.
A collaborative effort between McKinsey and Nielsen, our global benchmark reveals what “winners”
do differently from “others”—winners being companies that achieved higher sales growth than
the categories they play in, while also outperforming peers on one or more commercial metrics.
We found, for instance, that winners in the Chinese market invest in generating both offline and online
consumer insights. As the exhibit shows, all winners say they understand the in-store consumer decision
journey, and about 80 percent of winners (but only 25 percent of others) say they understand the

Who’s shopping where?
The power of geospatial analytics
in omnichannel retail
Using advanced geospatial analytics, retailers can now quantify the true
economic value of each of their stores across channels—and they’re uncovering
surprising insights.
Alana Podreciks, Nathan Uhlenbrock, and Kelly Ungerman

The wave of store closures across the US retail sector
continues. In 2017 alone, more than 7,000 stores
went dark, unable to withstand consumers’ rapid
migration to e-commerce, the explosive growth of
direct-to-consumer brands, and the glut of retail
square footage in the heavily overstored US market.
Retail space per capita in the United States is 15 to
20 times that of other major developed markets.
Customer traffic at malls has been steadily decreasing.
Margins are declining in almost every retail category.
Given these trends, it’s becoming harder to justify
keeping expensive brick-and-mortar stores open if
they don’t meet sales expectations. In the first
half of 2018, retailers announced plans to shutter an
additional 4,000-plus US stores.
Unfortunately, retailers often make the wrong decisions
about which stores to close, thus inadvertently hurting
their business further. They also overlook valuable
opportunities to expand their market presence
and unlock growth. The main reason is that they’re
using outdated metrics: many retailers continue to
use a combination of trend analysis and “four-wall
economics” to assess store performance—that is,
they’re still primarily taking into account the sales and
profits that the store generates within its four walls,
without considering its impact on other channels. This
assessment then affects other decisions, including the
store’s payroll, labor coverage, and sometimes inventory
selection. However, consumers today shop across
channels: they might visit stores to look at products and
then eventually buy them online, or they might research
a product online and then buy it in a store. In this
environment, the traditional four-wall metrics are, at
best, incomplete indicators of a store’s potential.
The most sophisticated retailers are now closely
examining the interplay between offline and online
customer decision journeys. They’re taking an
omnichannel view of store performance—allowing
each store to “get credit” for all the sales in which
it played a role, whether those sales happened offline
or online. In doing so, retailers are getting a more

accurate picture of each store’s total economic
value and making better decisions about their
omnichannel presence. Their secret weapon?
Advanced geospatial analytics.

Outside the four walls
Physical stores aren’t going away. We estimate that
in-store sales will still make up 75 to 85 percent of
retail sales by 2025. That said, the physical store is no
longer just a place to buy products. A store now plays
several possible roles: it might serve as an experiential
showroom for products, a fulfillment center for
online orders (or a convenient place for returning or
exchanging online purchases), a hangout where groups
of friends can try things on and take selfies that they
then post on social media, or a destination for those
seeking ideas and inspiration. It’s entirely possible for
a store to have weak sales and profits within its four
walls while being a strong contributor to the retailer’s
overall performance.
Advances in data and analytics can help a retailer
quantify both a store’s halo effect (positive) and its
cannibalization effect (negative)—in other words,
how a store’s existence influences the performance
of the retailer’s other sales channels (Exhibit 1).
Retailers have long recognized that a store can have
a halo effect, but it has traditionally been thought of in
marketing terms—that is, a store can raise awareness
of the retailer’s brand, just like a billboard or a TV
commercial. Viewed as such, the halo effect has been
difficult to measure. However, in an omnichannel
world, a store can do more than just raise awareness;
it can drive sales through other channels, and vice
versa. McKinsey research suggests that a store’s
e-commerce halo can account for 20 to 40 percent of
its total economic value.

A new era in data and analytics
For decades, retailers have been mining a variety of
data sets—point-of-sale information, demographics,
market trends, and so on—to learn about customers
and serve them better. Today, thanks to the availability

At the most sophisticated retailers, geospatial data

of advanced analytics across silos. It delivers crosscutting insights that bring together the priorities of
various functions, including marketing, sales, finance,
and real estate.

retailers are using these insights to mobilize their sales

more consumer-behavior data than they’ve ever had
before, in the form of opt-in e-receipt programs and
anonymized mobile-phone location data.

Consider the case of a global specialty retailer that
sells its products through its own brick-and-mortar
stores, an online store, and wholesale accounts. The
retailer’s sales were declining in the face of strong
competition. For insights into how to reverse its sales
trend across the network, the company turned to
geospatial machine learning.

The aggregated data can shed light on not just the
quantity but also the quality of customer traffic. This
information allows retailers to get a detailed picture
of how people move and interact within a market,
as well as how they behave across both offline and
online channels.

A team of data scientists built an analytical model
customized for the brand, leveraging both internal
and external data. Testing hundreds of variables, the
team used geospatial machine learning to identify
the factors that have the greatest positive or negative
effect on a zip code’s total sales (Exhibit 2).

And it’s not just that there are more data. Companies
now also have access to increased analytical
horsepower in machine-learning models. These

Based on these drivers, the team was able to predict the
retailer’s potential sales in each zip code and each store,
and to compare potential sales with actual sales. Then,

using geospatial simulation, it estimated each store’s
impact on wholesale and online sales.
The team was also able to isolate the unique factors
that contribute to a strong e-commerce halo. It found
that, in general, a store has a strong e-commerce
halo if it is a larger store located in an area with
a high proportion of young and urban professionals.
Other factors that contribute to a strong e-commerce
halo: being far from other same-brand stores, being
in a high-traffic retail environment such as a highquality mall or a power shopping center, and having
low tourist spend (which means most of the store’s
customers live or work nearby).

The retailer used these insights to identify which
stores weren’t living up to their sales and profit
potential (Exhibit 3) and which micromarkets
represented untapped growth opportunities. Further
analysis revealed that the retailer could optimize the
omnichannel value of its store network and achieve
a 20 percent gain in EBITDA by closing, relocating, or
reformatting stores (for instance, turning a full-priced
store into a digital showroom).
The retailer then created market-level “battle plans”
for its store network: which stores to reformat or close,
where to increase its presence either via new stores or
deeper wholesale penetration, and what the sequence
and scope of its investments would be.

Getting started
In kicking off a geospatial analytics effort, every
retailer will have a different starting point. We
recommend that companies first conduct an
internal inventory of data availability and advancedanalytics capabilities.
Some retailers have limited data (for example, low
visibility into wholesale accounts), siloed business
units, and only a handful of data scientists and
analysts, if any. These retailers should build their

52

minimum data requirements and consider
partnering with external providers or acquiring
analytics capabilities outright.
On the other end of the spectrum, some retailers
already have extensive external data partnerships,
consistent and reliable data-sharing processes with
their wholesale accounts, and senior management
focused on omnichannel success. Such retailers
can opt to build a strong data-science team with
experience in geospatial analytics. That team would

be tasked not just with performing the analyses but
also with generating useful insights that can be easily
integrated into real-time business processes and
decision making.
Regardless of their “build, buy, or partner” decision,
retailers must constantly strive to break down
business silos. If the heads of the retail, e-commerce,
wholesale, marketing, real-estate, and finance
functions all operate independently of one another and
have few or no cross-cutting goals or initiatives,
the company as a whole won’t be able to make the best
omnichannel decisions.

In our experience, retailers can quantify performance
gaps, uncover growth opportunities in their go-tomarket strategy, and reap early wins from advanced
geospatial analytics within 6 to 12 months—particularly
when an empowered, cross-functional team is leading
the charge. Successful pilots in one or two markets
can quickly build buy-in for a global rollout. By
harnessing the power of geospatial analytics, retailers
can capture the omnichannel customer—which,
in the near future, could very well be the only kind of
customer there is.

Innovation is central to the mission, values, and
agenda of most consumer-packaged-goods (CPG)
companies. However, in the past several years,
incumbent CPG companies have struggled to keep
pace with start-ups, which have reinvigorated
and reinvented categories ranging from ice cream
to diapers.
Our analysis of the food and beverage market from
2013 to 2017 reveals that the top 25 manufacturers
are responsible for 59 percent of sales but only
2 percent of category growth. Conversely, 44 percent
of category growth has come from the next
400 manufacturers.1 Our experience in working
with large consumer companies suggests that they
don’t suffer from a lack of ideas; where they struggle
is in knowing where to make bets, moving products
quickly to launch, and then nurturing them to scale.
Effectively driving growth through innovation
requires CPG companies to evolve many of the
assets and capabilities already in place and adopt
significantly different and new ways of working.
These changes will not be easy. Many of the innovation
systems that need to evolve are deeply entrenched.
They have their own brand names, dedicated IT
systems, firmly established management routines, and
more. However, our work with CPG organizations has
convinced us that these changes are necessary and can
return significant value.
Our analysis of approximately 350 CPG companies
across 21 subcategories found that growth leaders
excelled at harnessing commercial capabilities,
including innovation. Additional McKinsey analysis
has shown that CPG “creator” companies—those
that consistently develop new products or services—
grow more than their peers. These winning creators
have adopted a formula that borrows the best from
progressive new players while fully leveraging
existing advantages in scope and scale.

How did we get here?
For the past two decades, CPG innovation models
have been designed to maintain and grow already-atscale brands. This meant that most innovations were
largely incremental moves, with the occasional oneoff disruptive success. This slow and steady approach
worked because CPG companies didn’t really need
disruptive innovation to grow. Geographic expansion,
pricing, and brand extensions were all successful
strategies that kept the top line moving. As a result,
most of the systems designed to manage these
innovations were optimized for fairly predictable and
low-volatility initiatives. They emphasized reliability
and risk management.
That very success, however, led to calcified thinking
as companies built large brands and poured resources
into supporting and protecting them. In recent
years, as CPG companies have tried to respond to
new entrants and rapidly changing consumer needs,
they found that their innovation systems tended to
stifle and stall more disruptive efforts. As the returns
from innovation dwindled, companies cut marketing,
insights, and innovation budgets to cover profit
shortfalls. This created a negative cycle. As a stopgap,
many large consumer companies have turned to M&A
to fill holes in the innovation portfolio—but on its
own, M&A can be a very expensive path to growth
with its own difficulties in scalability and cultural fit.
How upstarts “do” innovation—through speed, agility,
and a consumer-first approach—is not exactly a secret.
Many CPG companies have made concerted efforts
to embrace those attributes by setting up incubators,
garages, and labs. They have tried to become agile
and use test-and-learn programs. But while there
have been notable successes, they tend to be episodic
or fail to scale because they happen at the periphery
of the main innovation system or even as explicit
“exemptions” from standard processes. Scaled success
requires making disruptive innovation part of the
normal course of business.

From lab to leader: How consumer companies can drive growth at scale with disruptive innovation

55

What to learn from today’s innovators
Despite the many challenges, there are consumer
companies winning in the market and driving
profitable growth. Here are four shifts they’re making.

usage occasions rather than just segments or
categories (we call these “growth maps”). These
can reveal how a seemingly niche and emerging
trend could have surprisingly broad reach
and applicability.

1. Focus on targeted consumer needs
All of us can think of innovative products that are
competing head to head in established categories (some
include Halo Top Creamery, SkinnyPop, and Blue
Buffalo). A common denominator for most of them
is that they didn’t start big but focused instead on
a targeted and unmet consumer need that turned out
to have broad reach.
That approach stands in stark contrast to the standard
CPG model, in which companies look for the products
that satisfy the largest group (the general population,
or “gen pop”). An important reason for this focus is that
many CPG companies need an idea to be big enough
to make a dent in their business. They also look to get
the highest return on investment for innovations to
amortize the high costs historically required to launch
(especially ad campaigns and capital expenditures
for new manufacturing). But in a world where it is
less expensive and easier than ever for companies to
address more targeted needs, and where consumers
have never had more choices at their fingertips,
satisfying the gen pop is becoming less and less viable
as an objective or requirement.
This isn’t to suggest that large CPG companies should
stop looking for substantial and growing opportunities.
But the evidence is clear that there are plenty of products
that start small—and would normally be killed off at a
large CPG company—but explode once in the market.
All strong innovation begins with the ability to identify
a consumer need that the marketplace isn’t addressing.
That happens through actions such as the following:

 Exploring granular consumer needs with
advanced analytics. CPG leaders explore
opportunities through highly granular, data-rich
maps of product benefits, consumer needs, and
56

 Combining many data sources to address
tipping-point trends quickly. Leaders combine
various types of data (such as consumer, business,
and technology data) from a range of sources
to identify market trends that are hitting relevant
tipping points. They understand where the
most promising trends are, where they have the
capabilities to play, and where they might need
to build new muscle. And they bring all this
together to rapidly prioritize where to take action.
 Using design thinking. By using empathy to
uncover unspoken and unmet needs, designing
new solutions with consumers and channel
partners, and rapidly prototyping and testing,
design thinking produces distinctive answers.
Importantly, true design thinking continues to
incorporate consumer insights and iterate product
designs even after initial product launch. Two
leading consumer companies in Japan recently set up
“innovation garages” to integrate design thinking into
product-development methods. They were excited
by the power of this integration to produce better, more
consumer-driven products radically faster.

2. Launch more “speedboats”—accepting that
some of them will sink
There is a prevailing myth that consumer companies
need to do a few big launches a year. Even if that were
once true, it no longer is. That approach required large
R&D investments, extensive consumer testing to
validate willingness to purchase, and massive resources
(such as large advertising, promotion, and distribution
budgets)—all in an attempt to predict success and perfect
a product before a large, potentially multicountry launch.
This mentality assumed the resulting product could not
fail once it hit the open market.

However, our findings suggest that putting all this
effort and funding to drive a successful launch
has not actually provided the desired results. In
packaged food, for example, a review of new brands
and disruptive innovations launched in 2013 by large
CPG companies found that only 25 percent were
still around four years later. This success rate is no
better than what start-ups and small CPG companies
achieved with much smaller budgets and programs
(Exhibit 1).
Winning innovators, in contrast, increasingly rely on
speedboats: smaller launches in which the product is
tested and refined in-market. Take the example of one
global CPG company that is extensively using “firstpurchase testing” to understand why consumers
are or are not purchasing a product, then integrating
that feedback into further iterations (Exhibit 2). It has

been testing real products in multiple nontraditional
settings, including office buildings, juice shops, and
yoga studios. The insights gained from these live
settings allow the company to iterate the product
design quickly. Once indicators of success are seen, it
moves to scale the product rapidly via Amazon and
traditional retailers. The approach works, because
in today’s ecosystem, there are many distribution
channels and digital and social-media outlets to
reach consumers less expensively as well as external
networks that can support efficient and productive
discovery and development.
The internet also provides an underutilized testing
ground for speedboats. Many disruptive brands
start by marketing directly to consumers, which
allows them to hone the product and messaging while
capturing detailed data on purchase behavior. Even

without e-commerce, most start-ups are heavily
using social media to reach targeted audiences with
lower cost and risk.
More speedboats, however, can mean more headaches
for general managers who must keep track of more
projects and then nurture products to scale. CPG
leaders address this through strong portfolio
management. They make clear, prioritized choices
about which categories and segments they will
innovate in and which ones they will maintain or exit
from. They put in place clear processes for tracking
performance and new allocation mechanisms to
get funds to promising programs quickly. And when
they need to scale new bets, they fund them by
reinvesting initial proceeds from the speedboats.

3. Think (and act) like a venture investor
Traditional stage-gate processes are very efficient for
managing a large pipeline of similar ideas through
a relatively standard development pathway. However,
when used for more disruptive initiatives, stage-gate
processes tend to systematically smother or starve

58

them. A different system is required for disruptive
innovation.
Consider how venture-capital firms manage
their portfolio of investments. They analyze each
investment on its own merits, adapting as businesses
evolve. They couple funding closely to the progress
of the new business and meet at the speed of its
progress versus on a predefined calendar. The hurdle
rates and key performance indicators are also different,
with emphasis on whether the business is gaining
consumer traction in addition to improving financials.
And more than anything, venture investors are
relentless in pushing the pace and urgency of growth.
For companies to deliver on this capability, we often
recommend that they establish their own venture
board comprising their strongest leaders. Even though
the scale may be small, this is some of the hardest work
in the company and the most important to its future.
Along with a few outsiders to inject a more objective
perspective, this board is responsible for maximizing
the return of the more aggressive portfolio—and has
complete autonomy to quickly make decisions about it.

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

4. Understand that first to scale beats first
to market
Launching disruptive innovation doesn’t mean
a company must always be the original inventor.
Rather than focusing on being first to market,
companies should focus on being first to scale.
We found that leading CPG innovators that actively
scan the market for high-potential ideas, watch for
emerging consumer acceptance and new behaviors,
and then jump in before the market landscape has
fully evolved have reaped significant rewards. We
evaluated 25 high-growth categories in four countries
across Asia, Europe, and North and South America. In
each, the players who took this approach are winning
approximately 60 to 80 percent of the time; in the
United States, they win the highest market share 80
percent of the time.
Incumbent CPG companies can turn to their
ingrained advantages to identify and scale these ideas.
Their wealth of consumer data can be used to spot
trends earlier than others. Their significant financial
and human resources can be disproportionately
allocated to hot opportunities. Since they have
distribution and account relationships with multiple
retailers, incumbents can expand the market for
new products more easily and quickly than new
players, with a smaller network of relationships, can.
Large CPG companies are also attractive partners
for innovators with insightful ideas but insufficient
resources to develop and scale them.
Many smaller players would love to acquire
incumbents’ advantages. Using these advantages to
their fullest requires CPG companies to adopt a
much stronger orientation toward speed, nurture

more disruptive bets until they can be scaled, and
reallocate resources to the biggest opportunities.

How to get started
Embracing the shifts we describe will require
meaningful changes. In our experience, the changes
are not only eminently achievable but also serve to
reenergize the organization as they make innovation
and delighting consumers more central and less
cumbersome to accomplish. We recommend CPG
leaders do five things now.

1. Address the culture
Business leaders understand how important culture
is but tend to think of it as a vague by-product of other
activities. Building an innovation culture begins
with making innovation essential to the day-to-day
business, and it’s critical that it start at the top, with
the CEO and senior-executive team. As one consumer
executive—who grew her company to a billion-dollar
valuation in fewer than 15 years—put it, “Innovation is
simply everyone’s job…. Everyone is expected to look
for insights, to bring ideas, to be ready to help drive an
initiative.” Other ingredients include a near-maniacal
focus on the consumer—by which we mean putting the
consumer at the center of every decision; incentives to
reward innovation; metrics that track innovation—such
as consumer excitement, word of mouth, and adoption
rates; and a clear understanding of how each person’s
role adds value to the process. Companies should reward
learning and make lessons easily available and shareable.

2. Create high aspirations and hard metrics
“Let’s increase growth by 2 to 3 percent!” That kind
of aspiration won’t motivate people and drive new
thinking. Contrast that rather vague hope with

Launching disruptive innovation doesn’t mean a company must
always be the original inventor. Rather than focusing on being
first to market, companies should focus on being first to scale.
From lab to leader: How consumer companies can drive growth at scale with disruptive innovation

59

this one from a mining company: “Generate
$150 million of incremental earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization over the next
five years by discovering new applications for our
products, moving closer to our end customers, and
leading our industry in production processes.” This
is bold, actionable, and measurable and gives teams
some sense of where and how they should innovate.
To track progress against aspirations, metrics need to
be specific, of course, but they also need to evolve.
For example, metrics on market share or growth
rate will be better in the earlier phase of a product’s
life cycle. Shift the focus to value and margin as the
project scales and matures. Metrics also must be in the
business-unit leader’s performance objectives.

3. Define the hunting grounds
Make clear choices about where you will innovate.
Be careful to define them by working backward from
the consumers and markets you serve rather than
the way you currently define your brand and category
structures, particularly in multibrand organizations.
Too often we see outdated guardrails unnecessarily
limit brands from exploring new spaces. As one CEO,
whose company was acquired by a leading global CPG
incumbent, put it, “If your consumers want your brand
to move into a space and you don’t [do so], then rest
assured, someone else will.”

60

use. As one innovative CPG leader in Asia–Pacific
said, “I established three simple mandates: bigger
(more top-line potential), better (more differentiated),
and faster (shorter time to market).” These mandates
drove top-line growth at four to five times the
underlying category growth.

5. Put a new disruptive innovation system in place
based on agile models
Driving success at scale requires a new model.
Innovative ideas can initially generate a lot of
excitement and promise. But that drive often wilts
when it needs to work with the full business to scale
the idea. While there is a broad range of elements in
a new innovation system, we find that the following
are a few of the most important:

 Establish cross-functional teams with a
complementary set of problem-solving skills.
These skills can include expertise in insights,
marketing, personnel, sales, user experience, and
tech. The team should “live” together, using an
agile development model, and ideally drive one to
two initiatives at any given time.

4. Reallocate resources

 Focus on constant learning and “derisking”
throughout development. Rather than use
a standard checklist of activities and stages, teams
should constantly identify and prioritize the
greatest uncertainties in a concept and conduct
quick tests to resolve them.

In our experience, most incumbent CPG companies
have too many resources committed to initiatives that
are unlikely to drive meaningful growth. The first
step in liberating resources is to take a hard look at
the portfolio and reallocate people to more aggressive
growth opportunities. Crucially, this cannot be an
annual or even quarterly exercise. Leading innovators
continually and ruthlessly reallocate resources and
make sure scarce people and dollars are put to the best

 Set up and prequalify your speedboat network.
This network can include factories, partners,
agencies, and vendors who can support smallscale procurement and manufacturing, run firstpurchase tests, and even support a riskier new
product’s first few years of manufacturing before
committing the capital expenditure for scaled or
global manufacturing.

The growth game has changed, but that doesn’t mean
that CPG companies can’t change with it. With a
commitment to new mind-sets and approaches, CPG
companies can harness speed and agility to move
again to the forefront of innovation.

Given the high level of uncertainty, fashion companies must invest in enhancing their productivity and
resilience. They must make 2019 their year of awakening—and come to terms with the fact that the old
rules no longer apply. Regardless of size or segment, fashion players now need to become nimble, think

Faster fashion: How to shorten
the apparel calendar
To get new styles into stores more quickly, fashion companies must
improve internal collaboration, tap into consumer insights, and start to
digitize the value chain.

When Burberry and Tom Ford began experimenting
with the fashion-industry concept known as “see
now, buy now” in 2016, their efforts were met with a
little skepticism and a lot of excitement. The thinking
was that consumers, especially millennials, have
become accustomed to instant gratification and are
therefore much less willing to wait several months
to own the latest runway styles. The “fast fashion”
companies—the likes of Forever 21, H&M, Inditex,
and Primark—were already producing replicas of
fresh-off-the-runway items and selling them in stores
in a matter of weeks, and consumers were rewarding
their speed to market: revenues at those companies
rose 8.2 percent in 2017 in aggregate, whereas overall
apparel retail grew only about 3.5 percent in that
same period.1 With a “see now, buy now” sales model,
luxury fashion companies, too, could capitalize on the
media coverage surrounding Fashion Week events
in New York, London, Milan, and Paris, and translate
the buzz into full-fledged sales campaigns.

and has the widest variability among companies
(exhibit). Therefore, that’s where the greatest potential
for compressing the calendar lies.
The length of the end-to-end fashion cycle depends on
a number of factors, including the company’s business
model and retailer requirements for the assortment.
For example, vertically integrated players (such as
H&M and Zara) can make decisions faster and skip the
sell-in phase because they operate their own stores.
Even within a brand, different product groups might
follow different calendars: women’s tops are typically
refreshed more frequently than women’s jeans, for
instance. Basic items (such as plain white T-shirts)
don’t have to follow a seasonal collection rhythm
because sales of such items are fairly consistent and
easier to predict. Still, some basics retailers—Uniqlo,
for one—are constantly finding ways to shorten their
fashion cycle.

Speeding up each phase
But skeptics wondered whether “see now, buy now”
could work for higher-end apparel. Indeed, it hasn’t
been an unqualified success. A handful of designers,
including Tom Ford, have since reversed course, citing
the misalignment between the timing of Fashion
Week and store shipping schedules. Still, more than
15 leading fashion companies are continuing to
experiment with “see now, buy now.” Is it a feasible
model for the long term?
Our answer is yes—so long as fashion companies are
willing to embark on a dramatic transformation of
their processes and mind-sets. Shortening the fashion
cycle isn’t a quick-fix undertaking.

The phases of the fashion cycle
Broadly speaking, the fashion cycle consists of
three phases: planning, design, and product development; sell-in; and production and delivery. The length of
each phase varies widely by company. A phase can be
as short as 12 weeks or as long as 30. The planning,
design, and development phase is typically the longest

Faster fashion: How to shorten the apparel calendar

To shorten time to market, the first step is to define
a viable target length for the full fashion cycle, taking
into account the company’s business model, retailer
requirements for the assortment, and benchmarks
from competitors—especially those that have
successfully shortened their own calendars. Once
the target length for the full cycle has been set, the
next step is to eliminate time-wasting activities and
accelerate processes in each phase.

Planning, design, and product development
In this first phase, the finance team sets financial
targets for the collection while the creative teams
for each division (such as women’s, men’s, and
children’s) determine the creative direction of the
season’s collection: What narratives or themes will
the collection embody? What will be the overall
look and feel? What fabrics and color palettes will it
feature? The creative teams also develop a master plan
specifying the breadth and depth of their respective
collections, along with price ranges. An example: the
Spring 2019 menswear collection will have 12 styles

At some apparel companies, the finance and creative
teams work separately, with each team unaware of what
the other is doing. This often results in inefficiencies
and rework. Leading-edge companies have instead
established a central merchandising team composed
of staff from both the financial and creative sides of
the business. This team collaborates on the creative
direction, the financial targets, and the master plan;
they agree on parameters early in the fashion cycle.
This collaboration can cut out unnecessary iterations
and shave up to five weeks off the initial phase.

Did a particular shirt sell well because of its color?
Cut? Logo design? Was it especially popular in a
certain city or neighborhood, or with a specific type
of customer? The most forward-looking companies
analyze additional types of publicly available data such
as online searches, social media, competitor websites,
and online product ratings. These analyses not only
unearth nascent trends but also warn of receding
trends. Some fashion companies have even begun
experimenting with natural-language processing and
visual processing, although these technologies can’t
yet reliably translate text or images (for example, from
tweets or Instagram posts by influencers) into clear,
actionable insights.

The central team typically reviews sales data from
the previous year, which can yield valuable consumer
insights and form the basis of sensible business
constraints. Advanced analytical tools and techniques
can help increase the reliability of forecasts by isolating
the factors that drove sales, down to the SKU level:

Generating consumer insights is one thing; instilling
a culture of insight-driven decision making is quite
another. It represents a major change, particularly for
fashion companies, which tend to see their business as
creative rather than data driven. The most successful
companies are those that strike a balance between

art and science. They invest in advanced-analytics
systems and tools and, just as important, they
ensure that there are “translators” and “connecters”
within the organization—people who are data savvy,
thoroughly understand the company’s business
processes, and have credibility among all internal
decision makers—to bridge the gaps between analysts
and designers.

showcase the collection to smaller retailers remotely;
those customers can then place their orders without
having to travel to a showroom at all. For larger
customers, fashion companies can create a few
physical samples but show most of the collection via
customized digital showrooms.
Initially, buyers may balk at being shown digital
prototypes instead of being able to touch, feel, and try
on every item in the collection. But we’ve found that
buyers come to appreciate the fact that 3-D design
allows them to give more input into the design process:
their suggestions can be incorporated into the designs
right away. Many more colors, cuts, and styles can be
tested and prototyped.

Sprinting toward a shorter fashion cycle

One company aimed to shorten its fashion cycle from
60 weeks to 44, largely by digitizing the value chain. To
do so, the company used an agile approach—a way
of working that more closely links conceptualization to
implementation through “sprints,” or fast-paced units of
progress. The idea of a sprint, aside from moving quickly,
is to constantly readjust so that each successive sprint
yields better results.

improves and renderings become more detailed and
truer to life (see sidebar, “Sprinting toward a shorter
fashion cycle”).

The company treated each season as a series of agile
sprints. Prior to each sprint, the team defined the
elements that would be tested. For instance, one test
involved digital design and prototyping of one product
group. The test was conducted in only two of the
four divisions, on a strict timeline following a “freeze
and release” logic. After each sprint, the team would
discuss what the obstacles and pain points were
and agree on how to do things differently in the next
sprint, which would have more ambitious targets. In one
sprint, designers felt that the design software was too
slow, the rendering of images was poor, and the library
of fabrics was too limited. A cross-functional team of
designers, process experts, and IT specialists worked
together to address these pain points.
The company not only achieved its goal of a 44-week
calendar—a goal that some in the organization initially
felt was unreachable—but it also produced a smaller
and less complex assortment. On-time availability and
production planning improved as well, thanks to better
forecasting that allowed the company to book factory
capacity ahead of time.

tasks (such as quality control) on-site at the factories,
eliminating the need to ship samples and products
back and forth between factory floor and design studio
or corporate office.

Production and delivery
Opportunities for shortening the production and
delivery phase are fewer but still meaningful. One
lever is disciplined manufacturer management.
Leading fashion companies have so tightly integrated
their manufacturing partners into their business that
manufacturers take responsibility for a variety of tasks
and approvals. In some cases, manufacturers bypass
several sign-offs from the head office, thereby cutting
as many as ten days from the production process. In
other cases, fashion companies have placed specific

68

As for capacity planning and booking, the earlier and
the more detailed, the better. At many companies, the
design teams for various divisions each have their own
schedule and process for informing vendors of their
needs for fabric, materials, and factory capacity. By
contrast, at best-practice companies, a central supplychain planning team consolidates orders from across
the divisions. Much as a central merchandising team
helps shorten the planning and product-development
phase, a central supply-chain team helps compress

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

the production phase. The team can approach vendors
with a single view of what the company’s needs
are, as early as six months in advance of production.
Another lever for shortening the production phase is
standardized vendor-management tools and interfaces.
Currently, fashion companies use a mishmash of legacy
systems, making vendor management cumbersome;
a lack of standardization results in wasted time and
rework. Each system asks for different inputs in different
formats, so the inputs are often incomplete or inaccurate.
Companies that have moved toward a single, intuitive
product-life-cycle management tool—one that can
accommodate sketches, photos of comparable products,
and many types of product information (on fabric, fit,
color, and so on)—have seen tremendous benefits.

Traditional fashion companies must be willing to not
just make cosmetic changes to their calendars but
also thoroughly examine each of their activities and
processes. They must also be willing to effect a change
in mind-sets across the organization. In doing so, they
could give the fast-fashion companies a run—maybe
even a sprint—for their money.

Delivering the goods, on time
and in full
E-commerce giants have raised the bar for supply-chain performance.
Now consumer-goods manufacturers face a stark choice: achieve new levels
of accuracy and responsiveness, or pay a heavy price.

As of mid-2018, approximately 60 percent of Amazon’s
US customers were members of the company’s Prime
premium delivery service. Those 95 million consumers
are worth a lot to the e-commerce giant; on average,
they spend $1,400 a year with the company, compared
with the $600 spent by nonmembers. In return, they
expect exceptionally high service levels. A key benefit
of Prime membership is two-day delivery at no
additional cost.
To meet its service promises, Amazon has invested
heavily in logistics infrastructure. As of July
2018, the company operated 122 fulfillment centers
in the United States, with another 44 planned or
under construction. The opening of those facilities
will take Amazon’s US warehouse space beyond
100 million square feet (9.29 million square meters).
The company’s distribution network isn’t just big—it’s
also remarkably high performing. Amazon’s network
operates with a third fewer days of inventory than
most major conventional retailers. Items are picked,
packed, and ready to ship two hours after a customer
order is placed. Amazon is also at the forefront of the
large-scale application of robotics and automation
systems in warehouse operations.
Where Amazon has led, the rest of the industry is
following rapidly. Walmart is developing a network
of dedicated e-commerce distribution centers
designed to allow next-day delivery of online orders
to 90 percent of the US population. Other top retailers
are making big investments to secure their position
in the online space, acquiring e-commerce rivals and
same-day logistics players as well as developing their
internal fulfillment capabilities.

Retailers put suppliers under pressure
As they ramp up their own service levels, retailers
expect their suppliers to shoulder some of the burden.
Leading retailers are tightening supplier service
expectations and imposing stiff financial penalties
for orders that are incomplete or that miss agreed-on
delivery windows. Kroger fines suppliers $500 for

Delivering the goods, on time and in full

each order delivered more than two days late, for
example, while Walmart charges suppliers 3 percent of
the purchase price for every order delivered early, late,
or incomplete. Both retailers have also narrowed the
delivery window for full truckloads from four days to
one or two.
As these sanctions become the norm across the
industry, they could create real pain for suppliers.
Our analysis suggests that penalties could add up to
more than $5 billion a year across the United States, if
the consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) sector doesn’t
improve its current delivery performance. Individual
CPG players could see their margins cut by a full
percentage point.
To compound these challenges, order complexity is
rising alongside service requirements. One way online
retailers compete is by offering their customers a much
wider selection than traditional brick-and-mortar
stores. As early as 2014, Amazon’s most important
US distribution centers already held more than five
million SKUs, for example. CPG players struggle with
complex orders: case-fill rates and on-time, in-full
shipments decrease sharply as the number of unique
line items in an order goes up (exhibit).

Supply-chain performance makes
the difference
This high-complexity, high-service world is an
uncomfortable prospect for consumer-goods manufacturers. Yet it also offers a significant opportunity.
Companies that can upgrade their supply-chain
performance to meet or exceed the expectations of
retailers won’t just avoid painful penalties—they will
also have the opportunity to get ahead of their rivals
by capturing market share in increasingly important
online channels and by securing preferred-supplier
status with major customers.
Achieving on-time, in-full delivery performance of 95
percent or more for even complex orders will require
manufacturers to take an end-to-end view of their

operations. Here are four top areas of opportunity:

Significantly improve predictive precision
The combination of big data, machine learning,
and advanced analytics can dramatically increase
the sophistication of demand forecasts, allowing
manufacturers to predict demand more accurately,
at a more a granular level, and over a longer time
horizon. In addition to improving inventory-allocation
decisions for base SKUs, these systems can also
help companies predict the impact of promotions and
new-product introductions.

72

One large, global CPG company applied machinelearning algorithms to more than 100 specific demand
drivers, including demographic and socioeconomic
data on the people living near its stores, as well as
local weather conditions. The approach allowed it
to improve forecast accuracy by 10 to 15 percent and
extend forward-looking visibility from ten days to
three months.
Even the smartest forecasting technologies can only
work with good data, and deliver results only if the
organization acts on their information. Therefore,
companies also need to ensure they have effective

collaboration and data sharing with suppliers and
customers. They should set an aspiration for
“no touch” planning to seamlessly translate forecasts
into production and deployment schedules.

Make execution flawless—and flexible
For a manufacturer’s plans to survive contact with
the real world, its manufacturing and warehouse
operations must work efficiently and reliably. The
best companies achieve these goals through
a combination of new technologies and old-fashioned
process discipline. They use lean methods and other
performance-improvement techniques to streamline
activities, cut error rates, and boost reliability. They
invest in robotics and automation, especially in
warehouse processes, to accelerate the handling of
complex orders. And they use smart IT tools to track
performance against targets in real time.
Another large consumer company built a real-time
performance “cockpit” covering all critical supplychain performance metrics across its planning,
manufacturing, and logistics-execution processes.
The system uses advanced algorithms to point
users to exceptions that require attention, and it
gives users the ability to drill down to the status
of individual SKUs in specific locations on particular
days. That way, users can isolate the problem and
intervene immediately when necessary.
Fast, flexible manufacturing, accurate planning,
and close coordination between commercial
and operations functions can create a virtuous

circle. Quick order-to-delivery lead times rely on
more-accurate, shorter-term forecasts. And when
manufacturing and logistics operations staff have
forecasts they can use with confidence, they can
further streamline their activities, cutting buffer
stocks and other sources of waste.

Reassess supply-chain assets
Just as retailers have redesigned their logistics networks
to meet higher service requirements and fulfill
omnichannel orders, CPG players will have to modify
their own supply-chain footprints. Fast, flexible supply
chains may require distribution facilities that are
located closer to critical customer facilities. The need
for greater reach without excessive costs will encourage
manufacturers to explore alternative ownership
models: outsourcing the operation of warehouses to
specialist providers, for example, or sharing facilities
with customers or other players.
In this context, a global CPG manufacturer is
undertaking a significant restructuring of its US
distribution network. The company is consolidating
distribution into fewer than a dozen primary centers
and a smaller number of “mixing centers,” with the
goal of reducing the delivery lead time for 80 percent
of its US production to less than 24 hours.
Relationships with carriers will evolve, too. To
achieve greater flexibility, manufactures may need
to balance relationships between companies that
have their own truck fleets and brokers that can access
additional capacity in the market. Carrier contracts

orders, consumer-packaged-goods players will have to
modify their own supply-chain footprints.

and incentive schemes will need to reflect the tight
schedule compliance required to meet stringent retailer
delivery windows. And the technology used to manage
shipments may require an upgrade, with seamless
information sharing between supplier, carrier, and
retailer, and greater use of track-and-trace systems
to monitor shipment progress and identify delays and
problems more rapidly.

None of the opportunities described above is a quick
fix. And consumer-goods companies will need to
address all of them if they are to achieve significant,
sustainable improvements in supply-chain
performance. Companies that want to get ahead in
the race for supply-chain superiority must build the
systems, processes, and infrastructure today that
will enable them to meet the customer expectations
of tomorrow.

Master the complexity pipeline
Some of the complexity that impairs CPG supply-chain
performance is self-inflicted. Poorly controlled newproduct-introduction processes can lead to portfolio
proliferation and skyrocketing numbers of SKUs to
forecast, manufacture, and manage. By raising supplychain-management costs while reducing delivery
performance, new-product introductions can result in
excess portfolio complexity that outweighs any profit
the new products generate.
To avoid this trap, one major consumer player
implemented an end-to-end complexity-reduction
program. The company revisited its SKU portfolio
and pipeline through the lenses of design-to-value
product design, total cost of complexity by SKU, pricepack architecture, and strategic importance. The
rationalized portfolio contained 20 percent fewer
SKUs but allowed the company to improve sales by
more than two percentage points and net margin
by more than five points.

Beyond procurement:
Transforming indirect spending
in retail
If retailers treat indirect costs as an opportunity for business transformation
rather than just a procurement matter, they can boost return on sales by as
much as 2 percent.
Steve Hoffman and Patrik Silén

76

For retailers seeking to cut costs and generate cash for
growth investments, indirect spending can be a big
untapped opportunity. Indirect costs—the goods and
services that retailers purchase but don’t resell—are
equivalent to 10 to 15 percent of sales on average, and
most retailers know that their indirect spending is far
from optimized. But while recognizing the potential is
easy, capturing it has proven stubbornly difficult.
The challenges aren’t new. They include a lack of
spending visibility, fragmented ownership and spend
authority, a dearth of incentives to reduce indirect
spend, and a siloed approach to procurement of notfor-resale (NFR) categories. In addition, indirect
procurement typically focuses on negotiations
with suppliers over price, rather than on higher-impact
opportunities to optimize what and how the retailer
buys. Our research has also shown that capabilities
and resourcing for NFR procurement in retail are
significantly weaker than in many other sectors: NFR
goods and services are viewed as much less important
than goods for resale, so the NFR sourcing staff
tends to receive less management attention and less
investment in talent. Furthermore, even NFR sourcing
professionals typically have little expertise in NFR
categories. Rare is the procurement team that has deep
knowledge of, say, elevator maintenance or marketingagency overhead costs.
Visionary retailers, however, are taking a radical
new approach to indirect spending—and achieving
radical results. These retailers aren’t viewing
indirect costs as a concern only for the procurement
function. Instead, they’re looking to transform
indirect spending across the entire business. They’re
overcoming the challenges by leveraging three new
ways of working: a cross-functional approach that
incorporates category-specific demand levers, the
use of digital and analytical tools, and stronger
supplier collaboration. And they’re taking specific
actions to bring about lasting change in mind-sets
and behaviors.

Beyond procurement: Transforming indirect spending in retail

In doing so, retailers are shaving as much as 10 to
15 percent off their annual indirect spend, capturing
impact worth 1 to 2 percent in return on sales, and
seeing a more than 15-fold return on the cost of their
NFR sourcing team. We’ve found that the value at
stake is remarkably consistent across retailers—even
at those that have been working on reducing indirect
costs for a long time, whether in-house or with
external support.

A business transformation
To capture maximum value from a cost-reduction
program, retailers must be deliberate about the
program’s scope and ambition level. A broad scope
and high targets are indispensable elements of a truly
transformative effort.
Historically, retailers have cut costs primarily by
reducing store labor or travel expenses. Few retailers
have tapped into the full potential of optimizing NFR
spending (Exhibit 1). Furthermore, even retailers
explicitly seeking to reduce indirect spending
sometimes ring-fence certain cost categories as “not
addressable.” For instance, some retailers consider
marketing expenditures out of scope; their rationale is
that marketing is critical to the core business of retail.
Other retailers don’t bother trying to lower rents,
because they assume that they can’t renegotiate terms
unless they’re in financial distress. Some indirect
costs—such as supplier-managed logistics—remain
unchallenged because they’re “hidden” in cost of
goods sold. And some retailers look for cost-reduction
opportunities only in operating expenses, leaving
all capital expenditures untouched—even though
the latter often has higher savings potential (as a
percentage of costs).
In bypassing these categories, retailers are forfeiting
more than half of the potential impact and missing
out on the synergies that a large-scale program could
bring. To achieve transformative change in indirect
spending, there can be no sacred cows.

Another must-do for a transformation program: set
stretch targets that inspire creativity and out-ofthe-box thinking. To set its NFR targets, one retailer
first conducted a fact-based diagnostic that was
championed by senior leaders. This exercise helped
the organization understand that the program was
a priority, adopt a transformational rather than an
incremental mind-set, and focus on how to achieve the
targets rather than on trying to change them.

New ways of working
Seeing an NFR effort as a business transformation is
a crucial first step. To maximize NFR savings, retailers
then need to adopt three new ways of working.

A cross-functional approach incorporating
category-specific demand levers
Transformation of indirect spend will require the
involvement and commitment of more than just
78

the procurement staff. A cross-functional team can
break down silos, pose tough questions about what the
business really needs, and make balanced trade-offs.
A cross-functional team can pull the basic suppliermanagement levers (such as competitive bids and
supplier consolidation) that affect who the retailer
buys from and at what price. The team can also pull
process-management levers, which influence how
a retailer buys: if the various functions comply with
procurement policies and use only preferred vendors,
maverick spending will be reduced or even eliminated.
Savings across the organization can be more easily
tracked. The retailer can better negotiate vendor
payment terms and cycles to its benefit.
Most important, a cross-functional team will be better
placed to pull category-specific demand-management
levers, which influence what the retailer buys. In our

Perspectives on retail and consumer goods Number 7, January 2019

experience, these levers deliver as much as half of the
potential savings—or even more for mature companies,
because negotiating for lower prices yields diminishing
returns over time. The biggest opportunities are
often in areas that many retailers consider out of scope,
such as marketing (by using a return-on-investment
approach, for instance) or logistics (using levers such as
inventory reduction or network redesign).
A retailer seeking to optimize logistics spending
tasked a cross-functional team with redesigning
its distribution network. The team was able to
reduce end-to-end costs by selectively increasing
certain logistics costs. For example, it switched
some deliveries from sea to air in order to gain sales
and reduce markdowns. It also increased delivery
frequency for some products and stores while
decreasing it for others.

The use of digital and analytical tools
Digitization has revolutionized every business process
and will continue to do so; indirect sourcing is no
exception.1 Today, leading retailers are using digital
and analytical tools in the following areas to achieve
dramatic reductions in indirect costs:
 Spend visibility. Advanced digital solutions,
powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning, enable retailers to rapidly
and accurately map the relevant spend base into
granular categories, shedding light on exactly
who spends how much on what. Cutting-edge
digital procurement solutions can pull purchaseorder (PO) and invoice data from multiple
systems to create a “spend cube,” automatically
generating benchmarks on pricing and specs,
as well as dashboards and reports to help category
managers monitor spending. One retailer
had recently streamlined its headquarters
organization but found through AI-supported
spend mapping that many of the costs had crept
back in through the use of contractors and
temporary labor. Once the retailer generated the
spend cube using an agreed taxonomy, it could lock

down a baseline and see how much it was spending
on contracted versus uncontracted vendors.
 Consumer insights. A retailer used digital
consumer surveys and crowdsourced competitor
benchmarks to understand, address, and retest
consumer perceptions of store cleanliness.
Which areas of the store did consumers notice
most? Which areas did they hardly notice at
all? Analysis showed that the parking lot and
the sidewalks were perceived as clean enough,
so instead of hiring a cleaner to do a thorough
cleaning multiple times a day, the retailer cut
back to once a day, with store associates doing
spot checks every few hours. The surveys also
revealed places—such as fitting rooms and the
shoe department—where the retailer could invest
in more frequent cleaning to boost customer
satisfaction. The business-insights team then
measured the exact impact of these adjustments
on the retailer’s sales.
 Design to value. A retailer reduced the cost of its
paper shopping bags by 25 percent by redesigning
them. Through digital analysis of basket size,
product dimensions, and data from cashier surveys,
the retailer determined the ideal dimensions
of a shopping bag based on the distribution of
physical volume and weight of products. Further
digital analysis—along with input from cashiers,
baggers, and vendors—helped the retailer arrive
at the substrate composition that would give the
shopping bags the right levels of puncture strength
and tensile strength.
 Clean sheeting. Digital clean-sheeting tools
can reduce indirect costs by as much as
40 percent in a category. Such tools typically
feature algorithms for determining costs in
various NFR areas, dynamic databases of input
costs (such as raw-material index prices), and
a sophisticated calculation engine. Through
a clean-sheeting exercise, one retailer discovered
that it was paying much more than the “should
cost” for water-bottle labels (Exhibit 2).

benefits of stronger supplier relationships: better

efficiency, and lower total cost.

this way: “Half goes to the CFO, but the other half
we get to keep.”) The head office should, of course,
have enough visibility into the reinvestments
to ensure they align with corporate priorities and
generate strong returns.

The elements of successful supplier collaboration
include focusing on a limited number of suppliers to
deliver the highest return on investment, establishing
a robust value-sharing agreement at the outset, creating
a dedicated supplier-collaboration team separate from
but aligned with category managers, and building
a disciplined performance-management and benefitstracking system.

Intelligent target setting also helps foster
understanding across the organization. Targets
should be based on detailed diagnostics, including
benchmarking against a relevant peer set. Otherwise,
stakeholders will reject the targets as arbitrary;
there’s also a risk of damaging the business by
pushing it into “slash and burn” cost cutting. The
diagnostics should yield not just a single target—
say, $100 million in cost savings—but also a set of
quantified initiatives. Targets should include cost
ratios (for example, logistics spending as a percent of
sales) rather than just absolute numbers, to ensure
that cost efficiency genuinely improves even when
the category experiences tailwinds. (For example, a
decline in logistics costs due to a decline in sales isn’t
really an improvement.)

One retailer, when retendering its contracts for
outsourced warehousing, required suppliers to
submit proposals for improving the joint warehousing
operation. Based partly on these proposals, the
retailer reduced its supplier count to two, allowing
for closer collaboration while maintaining some
competitive tension. The retailer built continuousimprovement targets into the contracts, with
gainsharing incentives for the suppliers. It also
invested in a “lean warehousing” team that works
closely with the suppliers to build capabilities.

Getting it done
Retailers must embed these new ways of working
into daily tasks. To sustain behavioral change, they
must then use all four parts of the “influence model”
(Exhibit 3). 2

Because indirect sourcing is typically perceived as
a backwater and procurement staff can feel they’re
performing thankless work, external visibility can be
highly motivating. When retail CEOs publicize their
NFR initiatives and targets, the people involved in
the initiatives see that their work matters and even has
the power to influence their company’s stock price.

Leading retailers lay out a clear case for change
and help each stakeholder connect to it on a personal
level. An important aspect of the change story is
communicating why savings are needed and what
they will be used for. Allowing business units or
functions to reinvest part of the savings can increase
motivation. (One initiative leader at a retailer put it

Along the NFR journey, there will be times when
stakeholders resist change for fear of negatively
affecting sales. A test-and-learn culture can overcome
this. A first step can be to show mock-ups or samples
of proposed changes. One retailer’s procurement
team recommended using thinner, cheaper paper for
marketing materials. It overcame resistance from the
marketing department by having samples printed on
the thinner paper and using blind testing to demonstrate
that the materials were just as effective.

focuses on only a few, either on a rotating basis or to

sound like an enormous investment, the retailer
recouped the cost of those employees’ yearlong efforts
about 50 times over in recurring savings.
Neither the program leader nor the team members can
be expected to have all the relevant category-specific
expertise. Our research shows that retailers have eight
times the indirect spend per procurement professional
compared with other sectors, which means their level
of expertise in any particular category will be relatively
shallow. Therefore, tapping into internal and external
category experts is crucial. One grocery retailer
discovered that one of its project managers had been
a refrigeration engineer for 25 years. The company
brought him into a team tasked with reducing the lifecycle cost of refrigeration, heating, and cooling assets
by 30 percent in two years. The team achieved the
goal in six months and did so with simple solutions—
for example, changing the type of price tags used in
refrigerated shelves so that the tags wouldn’t fall off
and clog the drain. This change saved the retailer more
than $600,000 a year.
Capability building is also key. The best companies
use a combination of classroom training, e-learning
tools, and on-the-job coaching. In our experience,
many NFR professionals who receive functional

and category-specific training and mentoring

immediately double or triple their effectiveness.
A phased train-the-trainer approach—in which the
sourcing team receives training during a pilot phase,
applies the learnings to an initial set of categories,
then trains others in the next phase—has proven
effective in many cases.

Role modeling
The CEO, CFO, and the rest of the management
team must work together to communicate the case
for change and role model the desired mind-sets and
behaviors. Working as a cross-functional steering
committee, they can remove roadblocks, surface
and capture cross-functional opportunities, and
allocate enough resources to them, thereby sending
an unmistakable message to the organization about
the importance of these initiatives.
Another powerful role-modeling lever is senior
sponsorship of initiatives. Senior leaders can
serve as coaches for the owners of individual category
initiatives, whether those owners are within or
outside the senior leaders’ respective functions.
Helping to secure—and then celebrate— early wins
is also a form of role modeling. It lets the entire

Our research shows that retailers have eight times the indirect

organization see that senior leaders are committed
to ensuring the NFR program’s success and that they
recognize its impact.

Most retailers have significant opportunities
to reduce indirect costs. The first step is to
acknowledge that the potential exists, then conduct
a thorough diagnostic to quantify it. Though
challenging, a transformation in indirect spending
can yield greater profitability, funding for growth,
and competitive advantage.

Q U I CK TA K E S

Are your fruits and vegetables
top-notch?
Daniel Läubli and Nora Ottink

When shopping for fresh produce in the summertime, European consumers pay close
attention to the quality of apples, bananas, tomatoes, and lettuce (exhibit). These insights
were among those generated in our first-of-its-kind benchmarking survey of more than
23,000 grocery shoppers in four European countries.
Our research demonstrates that quality is the biggest factor in whether a customer will
recommend a store’s fresh-produce department to other people. Low prices and frequent
promotions matter, too, but not as much as quality. Furthermore, quality perception
is influenced by only a handful of products—usually fewer than ten. If a retailer improves
the quality of just these few products in its stores, it will move the needle on customer
satisfaction significantly. We call these products “key quality items” (KQIs).
Retailers should prioritize KQIs for quality investments. As the exhibit shows, the KQIs in the
fresh-produce department differ by country and by season.
