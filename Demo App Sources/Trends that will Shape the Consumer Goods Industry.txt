The consumer-packaged-goods
(CPG) industry’s growth over the past
quarter century has been nothing
short of exhilarating. CPG companies
have launched innovative products
to meet an ever-growing array of
human needs and desires. They have
expanded rapidly into the burgeoning
consumer markets of the developing
world. And to make this breakneck
growth possible and profitable, they
have aggressively built global scale
along every part of the value chain.
These strategies, along with increased
margins and weighting of portfolios
toward fast-growing categories, have
delivered stellar shareholder returns.
But the past is no guide to the future.
Over the coming decade, upheavals in
global consumer and supply markets
are likely to produce as many losers as
winners among CPG companies. For
example, Asia will overtake the West
as the main consumer market, and it
will demand new levels of value and
innovation from CPG players. Rising
Internet penetration could upend
traditional sales models. Globalized
trading and natural-resource
shortages could combine to usher in
a new age of supply chain volatility.
In this article, we profile an analytical
approach, developed by McKinsey’s
CPG practice, that allows executives
to filter the myriad potential future
trends to anticipate the few that
could truly affect their company’s
competitive advantage. We then apply
the approach to the CPG industry in
aggregate, underlining the forces most
likely to move the needle on value
creation over the coming decade and
pointing to the strategic questions
that CPG companies must answer if
they are to profit from these forces.

The strategic
choices
behind the
industry’s
success
Before assessing the trends of the
future, it is worth asking what has
driven the industry’s extraordinary
performance in recent decades.
US-listed CPG companies, for
example, have increased total
returns to shareholders (TRS) by an
annual average of 10 percent over
the past 25 years, outperforming
not only the broader S&P 500 index
but also high-growth industries
such as information technology,
energy, and telecom (Exhibit 1).
To be sure, this growth has taken
place on the back of steadily rising
incomes and population, particularly
in emerging markets. But leading
CPG players have not simply followed
economic and demographic trends: they
have actively anticipated them in their
strategies and investment choices.

Constant innovation, along
with a knack for passing on
input-cost increases, has
allowed the industry to boost
its margins significantly.

To start, the industry has been relentless about new-product innovation. In the
US grocery channel, for example, the number of SKUs has grown by 50 percent in
just the past seven years.1 Constant innovation, along with a knack for passing on
input-cost increases, has allowed the industry to boost its margins significantly.
Further, CPG companies have expanded rapidly beyond their traditional Western
bases. Emerging markets have contributed more than half the global revenue of
the Coca-Cola Company since 2006, and almost half of PepsiCo’s 2009 revenue
was generated outside of the United States. At the same time, CPG companies
have aggressively shaped their portfolios to increase the proportion of the fastestgrowing and most profitable categories, creating considerable “momentum
growth.” Witness Nestlé’s recent acquisitions in high-growth food categories
such as baby food (Gerber), pet food (Purina), and frozen pizza (from Kraft).
To make this expansion possible—and profitable—CPG players have invested
heavily in building global scale along every part of the value chain, including
R&D, marketing and sales, procurement, manufacturing, and distribution.
Unilever’s ice-cream business is a salient example: it has rolled up its fragmented
brands under the “heart” umbrella brand, established a single global ice-cream
headquarters in Italy, and consolidated manufacturing in 16 plants worldwide.
Even over the tumultuous last three years, CPG companies have performed
well, thanks in large part to their diversified exposure to faster-growing
emerging markets and their longer-term pursuit of scale and efficiency.

Have the
rules of
the game
changed?
A framework
to analyze
future trends
“The only constant is change,” in the
words of the ancient Greek philosopher
Heraclitus. The upheavals in global
consumer, retail, and supply markets
over the coming decade threaten to
wreak havoc on established business
models and marketing approaches—and
promise huge rewards for those best
able to anticipate new opportunities.
How should CPG companies go about
analyzing these forces and prioritizing
those with the greatest likely impact
on their own competitive advantage?
McKinsey has developed an analytical
methodology to help executives provide
fact-based answers to these questions.
Here we provide a snapshot of the
methodology, filtering an array of global
trends to prioritize the few that will
have the greatest impact on the profits
of the CPG industry in aggregate over
the coming decade. For an individual
company or a particular category,
a tailored version of this filtering
exercise would yield distinct results.

In our industry-wide analysis, we considered 11 global trends (Exhibit 2)
across the demand side (for example, the rise of the value-orientated consumer
segment), the supply side (say, increasingly volatile input costs), and the external
environment (for instance, rising trade protectionism). While not exhaustive,
this list includes the principal forces likely to affect the CPG industry as a whole.
An analysis tailored for a particular company would include specific regional
or sector trends, such as food-industry regulations to prevent obesity.
Our next step was to prioritize these 11 trends. First we sized each trend
according to its likely impact on CPG companies’ gross profits.2 Then we
evaluated the likelihood of the occurrence of each trend—gauging the momentum
behind it, its resilience to external shocks, and the degree to which analysts
and stakeholders are aligned on it. Finally, we assessed the importance
attributed to each trend by CPG companies in their public communications.

Over the coming decade,
upheavals in global consumer
and supply markets are likely
to produce as many losers
as winners among CPG
companies.

2 For the sake of this analysis, we assumed that currencies will maintain their current relative
valuations through 2020.

Through this filtering process, we identified five trends that are both highly
probable and likely to have large impact on industry profits (Exhibit 3):
 A billion new middle-class consumers in emerging markets
 The rise of the digital consumer
 The shift to value
 The impact of demographic shifts, including aging,
on consumption patterns
 Increasingly volatile input costs, driven by natural-resource
shortages and the emergence of fewer, bigger suppliers
This is not to say that the other trends won’t matter in the decade ahead.
For example, green consumerism could combine with regulation to prompt
CPG companies to reduce their impact on the waste stream by greatly reducing
packaging. But in shaping strategy, companies need a fact-based way to rank and
quantify trends for their likely impact on profits. By this measure, our analysis
suggests that green trends and other headline-grabbers such as health and wellness
will have less impact on global CPG value creation than the five major trends above.

A billion new consumers in emerging markets
This decade marks the tipping point in a fundamental long-term economic
rebalancing. In the coming years, the growth of emerging markets
will continue to outstrip that of the developed world by a wide margin.
While the emerging countries in Asia—most notably China, India, and
Indonesia—already had a significant share of global growth (18 percent)
throughout the last decade, this growth share is expected to increase to
nearly 30 percent in the next decade. As a result, the global middle class will
expand dramatically: by 2020, there are expected to be more than 1 billion
new consumers spending between $10 and $100 per day3 (Exhibit 4).

The decade ahead:
Trends that will shape the consumer goods industry

Nearly everyone agrees on the importance of this trend, but understanding
these new consumers and meeting their needs will be no simple matter for CPG
players. Those who get it right stand to earn tremendous competitive advantage.
Success factors will include the selection of categories and markets—to ensure
that the company builds a leading position everywhere it plays—as well as
segmenting the billion new consumers and innovating to meet their needs.
Consider the example of Wrigley chewing gum in China: the company has
captured 40 percent of a fast-growing category already worth $2 billion.
Its tactics include regular launches of products tailored to Chinese consumers,
such as gum flavored with herbal essences and grapefruit; intensive consumer
education to emphasize chewing gum’s health benefits; and building a presence
in the millions of small outlets where Chinese consumers typically shop.
Further, winning CPG companies are likely to be those that create valueoriented products. In China’s ready-to-drink coffee market, for example, Nestlé
has reduced prices by 30 percent. To make this possible, it has cut its costs by
establishing a local supply base in Yunnan, and its sourcing is now 99 percent
Chinese. In India, Cadbury has introduced products at low price points (such as
its Perk brand) to attract more consumers to the chocolate category. However,
as emerging markets account for an increasing proportion of CPG sales, companies
will struggle to maintain their margins. Building scale will be one way of doing
so; skillful segmentation of emerging-market consumers will be another.
Within China’s wealthy population, for example, McKinsey research has identified
seven distinct segments, ranging from the “flashy,” who care about showing off
exclusive brands but are willing to purchase counterfeit goods, to the “urbane,”
who care more about quality and refuse to purchase counterfeit products.4
Across emerging markets, thoughtful segmentation will reveal many opportunities
to create value—and build healthy margins—by meeting specific consumer needs.
Finally, CPG companies with Western roots will need to consider how the
rise of emerging-market consumers might affect—and transform—their own
organizations. For a company with, say, 70 percent of its sales in China and
India by 2020, would it still be appropriate for the board to be dominated by
Westerners and the headquarters to be located in Europe or North America?

In the coming years, the
growth of emerging markets
will continue to outstrip
that of the developed
world by a wide margin.

The rise of the digital consumer
While technology has played a key role in the consumer goods industry’s
growth, it will be truly disruptive in the coming decade. In figuring out
how to win in this new digital world, CPG companies face some major
strategic questions—including how to build a successful business through
online retail channels, how to build brands and categories in a socially
networked world, and how to exploit technology-driven opportunities to
understand consumers more deeply and connect with them more often.
The proportion of sales via online channels may be reaching a tipping point. In the
United States, e-commerce now represents a $155 billion market, an estimated
6 percent of total retail sales.5 In the United Kingdom, as many as one-third of
adults say they now regularly shop for food online;6 the same is true in Germany
for apparel.7 In China, the online retail market has more than doubled in each of
the last three years and could exceed 1.3 billion renminbi ($200 million) by 2013.
To capture their fair share of this rapidly growing channel, CPG companies
must raise their game with online retailers. They must work in close
partnership with retailers to manage their online shelf space (including
how prominently their products appear on Web listings), run joint
targeted campaigns, and in general expand the category online.
There may also be the opportunity to sell directly to consumers. Manufacturers
in other consumer-facing industries have successfully shifted consumers
to e-commerce, allowing them to conduct transactions and even customize
products on branded sites. CPG companies must make a strategic choice on
whether and how to follow suit. Some have taken up the challenge: P&G, for
example, is piloting its own e-commerce site, www.pgestore.com. However,
manufacturers must weigh the trade-offs, and for many the economics of
launching a branded e-commerce site will prove unfavorable. For those
who decide against launching their own Web stores, online retail platforms
such as Amazon.com and Alice.com offer direct access to consumers.

The decade ahead:
Trends that will shape the consumer goods industry

Digital technology will have just as great an impact on brand communication.
Consumers are more reliant than ever on referrals: 70 percent look
to user reviews to inform their purchase decisions.8 Moreover,
digital marketing is no longer just about one-way communications to
consumers. User-generated content can be difficult to control, but it
also offers one of the best ways to influence consumer opinion.
In addition, social media provides an important channel for CPG companies
to “listen” to consumers without the biases created by conventional research
techniques. CPG companies are just starting to tap into social media to
understand brand buzz, monitor the impact of campaigns, and even gain input
into new product development. For example, Unilever used co-creation with its
online community to develop Axe Twist, a fragrance that changes throughout
the day. Companies that ignore this important new information source risk
being slower to respond and adapt to their consumers’ changing needs.
New media requires new capabilities, including rigorous performance
tracking, extensive digital-marketing analytics, and flexible vendor
management. Winning CPG companies will be those that invest in
these capabilities to keep pace with the digital consumer.

The shift to value
The global financial crisis has driven consumers to value offerings, and
it is a trend that is likely to stick. Recent McKinsey research suggests
that 70 percent of US consumers are looking for ways to save money.9
Fifteen percent are “trading down” to cheaper brands during the recession,
and almost half of consumers say their experience with cheaper brands,
including private labels, has exceeded their expectations.10
The shift to value has major implications for the CPG industry’s profit
formula. Not least, it could erode the pricing power of brands. Indeed, our
analysis suggests that private-label players are riding the value trend to
become a serious force across CPG categories, accounting for more than
40 percent of supermarket sales in the United Kingdom, more than 30
percent in Germany, and more than 15 percent in the United States.
CPG players are employing a variety of strategies to address this trend. Some
companies are trying to minimize retailers’ need to launch their own privatelabel brands. For example, a major chocolate company reduced its pack size
in the United Kingdom from 150 grams to 125 grams in order to keep the £1
($1.60) pack price on the shelf, a key concern for retailers. Some companies
are rationalizing their price lists to help retailers control SKU proliferation.

The decade ahead:
Trends that will shape the consumer goods industry

Other companies are riding the shift to value by running joint promotions
with private-label brands in adjacent categories. One major CPG company
in the United States is running joint displays and promotions with privatelabel players; for example, consumers receive a discount if they buy a
national brand of cheese along with a private-label bread brand.
Still other CPG companies are meeting the private-label challenge head-on
by introducing directly competing lower-priced products and through direct
comparisons in advertising that highlight the superiority of their own product.
Indeed, the winning companies of the future will be those best able to develop
strong value brands with both excellent functional benefits and competitive prices.
The shift to value will make scale an even greater competitive advantage
than before. The leading CPG companies have already harnessed their
global scale to reduce costs, pushing work to low-cost centers and
spreading fixed costs over a broader business. The stronger a company’s
overall market position and the more number-one category positions it
holds, the better equipped it will be to win in a value-focused world.

The impact of demographic shifts on consumption patterns
While consumer markets’ center of gravity will shift inexorably toward
the developing world over the coming decade, there will also be profound
demographic changes across all markets. In particular, the world’s population
is aging quickly. The United Nations projects that the total population
of people older than 65 will double to 1 billion over the next 20 years.11
By 2030, one in four Western Europeans will be elderly, as will one in five
North Americans. But the trend will be just as marked in the developing
world: China’s over-65 population will double to 16 percent of its total
population, while India’s will almost double, reaching 8.5 percent.
CPG companies will need to find innovative ways to meet the needs of aging
consumers. For example, Unilever’s Dove recently launched Pro-Age, a line
of deodorants, hair-care products, and skin-care products, to target female
consumers between the ages of 54 and 63. In packaged food, ConAgra
targets seniors with its Golden Cuisine brand, which offers nutritionally
balanced food in packaging that features easy-to-read, large fonts.
While aging represents one major global demographic trend for which CPG
companies must prepare, there are others that will be just as important
in key markets. In the United States, for example, Hispanics will make
up 23 percent of the population in 2030, up from 16 percent today, while
the white population will fall from 65 percent to 55 percent.12 The Census
Bureau predicts that the majority of children will be nonwhite by 2023.

The decade ahead:
Trends that will shape the consumer goods industry

Moreover, despite the global aging trend, pockets of younger consumers are
growing in key markets. In sub-Saharan Africa, where many observers expect
rapid economic growth in the coming decade, the United Nations predicts the
under-50 population will grow 23 percent, reaching about 700 million by 2020.
These micro-demographic shifts create additional opportunities for CPG
companies to capture growth. In the United States, for example, many companies
are experimenting to capture the growing Hispanic segment. Knowing that heavilyscented products are popular with Hispanics, P&G recently launched Gain laundry
detergents in lavender, citrus, and apple-mango scents. And for the first time, P&G
used a specialized marketing firm as its lead agency for Spanish-language media. 13

Increasing supply chain volatility
We have considered four demand-side trends. Just as disruptive, however, will
be one trend from the supply side: increasingly volatile input costs, driven by
the emergence of bigger, fewer suppliers and natural-resource shortages.
For the most successful CPG companies, globalized trading has represented a huge
opportunity to expand into new markets and consolidate supply and production.
Yet globalization, combined with specialization, has also triggered a sharp increase
in the global volatility of commodity input prices. Global supply chains that have
created so much value in the past could be exposed to higher volatility in the future.

The United Nations projects
that the total population of
people older than 65 will
double to 1 billion over
the next 20 years.

The increasingly concentrated production of several key commodities
illustrates this trend. For example, 57 percent of the world’s sugarcane
is now produced in Brazil and India (Exhibit 5), while China and Russia
together account for close to half of the world’s aluminum production.
A natural disaster or political crisis in any one of these countries could cause
severe disruption to global supply chains. Indeed, the 2010 earthquake
in Chile had just this effect on the global pulp market, cutting supply by
8 percent and triggering a spike in prices. Similarly, in late 2009, a fire at
one acrylic acid plant in Texas, combined with mechanical issues on one Dow
Chemical asset, created a global shortage in superabsorbent polymer, the key
ingredient in diapers, feminine-care products, and adult-care products.
Potential natural-resource shortages—notably, ever-increasing stress on
the global water supply—further increase volatility. As populations grow
and urban areas expand, the United Nations predicts water withdrawals
will increase 50 percent by 2025 in developing countries and 18 percent in
developed countries.14 As water shortages affect manufacturing centers for
CPG inputs, price increases could spread quickly across the supply chain.
CPG companies face some tough strategic questions as they ponder how
best to manage risk in light of this increased volatility—including the
price they are willing to pay to secure long-term supply stability, how to
reduce commodity and natural-resource inputs across the product line,
and how to build flexibility into their supply chains. Navigating exposure
to this volatility requires a new paradigm in risk management.
