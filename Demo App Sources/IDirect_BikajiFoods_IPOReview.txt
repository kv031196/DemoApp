The company commands gross margins ~30%. However, extremely high inflation 
in edible oils and other agri commodities has adversely impacted gross margins in 
the last two years. With the softening of edible oil prices, gross margin is likely to go 
back to the normalise level of ~30% in the next few quarters.

Industry overview 

Savoury snacks and sweets market in India 
The  Indian  savoury  snacks  market  was  valued  at  |  75,000  crore  in  2022  and  is 
expected to reach | 1.23 lakh crore by 2026, growing at CAGR of 13%. The Indian 
savoury  snacks  market  can  be  broadly  segmented  into  western  snacks  and 
traditional  snacks.  Traditional  snacks  market,  which  is  valued  at  |  36600  crore, 
contributes  around  48%  to  the  total  savoury  snacks  market.  Traditional  snacks 
market  comprises  of  namkeens,  bhujia  and  ethnic  snacks  such  as  dry  samosa, 
kachori, chakli, etc. The western snacks market was valued at | 38500 crore in 2022 
and  consists  of  chips,  extruders  and  a  new  variety  of  snacks  called  as  “bridges”, 
which has local taste but a western look. 

Snacking in between meals has always been traditional in Indian culture and Covid-
19 forced lockdown has increased this habit of snacking multi-fold. It is driving the 
growth  of  this  industry.  Further,  in  2022,  footfall  and  activity  levels  across  all 
touchpoints (retails, institutional, etc) have returned to pre-Covid levels. This trend 
seems to have continued in the Indian market. The Indian savoury snacks market is 
estimated to reach | 1.23 lakh crore by 2026 with organised players capturing a major 
market share due to increased concerns on hygiene and safety.

The organised segment has been strengthening its position in the market over the 
last few years with new product launches and product innovations that have been 
largely  targeted  at  the  urban  as  well  as  rural  consumer.  The  organised  savoury 
snacks market was valued at | 20,000 crore in 2015 and at | 42,000 crore in 2022. It 
is  further  expected  to  grow  at  a  CAGR  of  15%  to  |  74,000  crore  by  2026. 
Advertisement  and  promotions  play  a  major  role  in  the  growth  of  the  organised 
sector. With deep pockets, the organised segment can afford celebrity endorsements

and engagements with mega events in India. This has also been instrumental to the 
success of the organised sector. Western snacks still dominate the organised market 
with 57.2% of market share in the Indian savoury snacks segment. Ethnic namkeen 
and snacks contribute to 26.9% of the organised savoury market followed by ethnic 
bhujia, which is at 15.9% in the overall savoury snacks market in 2022.

Organised Ethnic snack market in India  

Ethnic namkeen and snack items mainly include namkeen, chaklis (variety of masala 
or  fried  nuts).  These  snacks  are  very  region  specific  within  India.  However,  with 
urbanisation and working population migration to different regions the demand for 
regional  snacks  is  increasing  on  a  pan-India  basis.  This  has  led  to  domestic 
expansion of many regional players like Bikaji, Chitale, etc. Organised Indian ethnic 
namkeen market in India is valued at | 11,400 crore, which is expected to grow at 
16% CAGR to | 20,400 crore by FY26.

Ethnic bhujia is another specialty of the traditional Indian savoury market. Despite its 
origin and larger consumption in Rajasthan, it has reached various parts of India as 
well as overseas markets. The category has evolved with the introduction of many 
variants over the years. The current organised market size of ethnic bhujia is | 6,700 
crore and it is growing at 15% CAGR.

The Indian sweet market is valued at | 59,300 crore with a major share coming from

Focus on expanding pan-India manufacturing & distribution reach 
BFL is expanding across geographies and trying to emerge as a dominant pan- India 
player.  Apart  from  its  core  market  of  Rajasthan,  the  company  has  a  very  strong 
presence  in  states  like  Bihar  and  Assam.  The  company  has,  over  the  years, 
established market leadership in the ethnic snacks market in its core three states and 
gradually expanded its footprint across India, with operations across 23 states and 
four  union  territories  serviced  through  2,416  distributors.  Its  pan-India  distribution 
network  and  well  established  brand  has  enabled  it  to  effectively  increase  market 
penetration and expand their footprint across India. In its core markets of Rajasthan, 
Assam and Bihar, the company has established deep penetration and enjoys, market 
share of~45%, 58% and 29%, respectively, in the total organised Indian ethnic snack 
category.  The  current  annual  production  capacity  for  ethnic  and  western  snacks, 
sweets and papad in Rajasthan is 2,150,000 tonnes and 12,000 tonnes for western 
snacks in Karnataka. A contract manufacturing unit has been set up in Kolkata for 
manufacturing chips, corn rings and other western snacks. New facilities have been 
started  in  states  of  Bihar  (Muzaffarpur),  UP  (Kanpur)  and  Rajasthan  (Bikaner)  for 
western  snacks  and  ethnic  savouries.  Apart  from  strong  domestic  presence,  the 
company is a leading exporter of Indian ethnic snacks, sweets, frozen food besides 
savouries to 35 countries of North America, Asia Pacific, Middle East, EU, Africa and 
UK  regions.  Exports  contributed  ~4.0%  of  total  sales  predominantly  in  North 
America and Asia Pacific regions in FY22.

insights on market trends to drive product development initiatives. BFL implements

automation solutions to further improve the efficiency in its supply chain. The market 
knowledge,  financial  resources  and  time  required  to  develop  such  a  distribution 
network  presents  a  significant  entry  barrier  for  competition.  The  company  has  a 
strong presence in railway stations across India, which gives immense visibility and 
major purchase space. It has started supplying products for sale in 30,000 canteen 
store department (CSD) stores from August onwards.

Key risks and concerns 

Raw material volatility may continue to pressurise margins 

The major raw materials for the company consist of mainly agri products like pulses, 
flours,  edible  oils,  spices,  seasonings  and  dairy  products  while  major  packaging 
materials include laminates, tin cans and cardboard boxes. In the last one year, all 
these materials witnessed unprecedented inflation, which adversely impacted gross 
margins.  Though  edible  oil  prices  have  softened  recently,  all  other  major 
commodities  still  remain  at  elevated  levels.  Volatility  in  raw  material  prices  could 
impact margin even in future. 

Sales concentrated in small number of states  

The  core  markets  for  the  company’s  products  are  Rajasthan,  Assam  and  Bihar. In 
FY22, it enjoyed a market share of ~45%, ~58% and ~29%, respectively, of total 
organised Indian ethnic snack category in Rajasthan, Assam and Bihar, respectively. 
The sales in core market is ~70% of BFL’s total sales. The opportunity in other states 
can be captured by competitors given the company’s manufacturing & distribution 
is relatively new in south & western markets. 

High competitive intensity 

The snack industry is highly competitive with the presence of multiple Indian as well 
as MNCs present in different sub-categories. The competition could further increase 
with new regional entrants in ethnic snacks category. The company has witnessed 
strong  20%  sales  CAGR  in  last  two years. However,  increasing  competition  could 
result in lower than historic growth for the company. Moreover, many bigger FMCG 
companies  enjoys  gross  margins  of  40%+  and  their  ability  to  spend  on 
advertisement is higher compared to the company. 

High dependence on wholesale network  

The  direct  distributors  associated  with  the  company  are  only  416  across  India 
whereas large part of the sales is coming from wholesalers given total wholesalers 
associated  with  the  company  are  1956.  Wholesale  channels  are  vulnerable  to 
economic  disruptions.  In  the  last  five  years,  the  wholesale  channel  was  adversely 
impacted by many disruptions like demonetisation, GST implementation, economic 
slowdown and Covid-19 outbreak. We believe BFL’s dependency on this channel is 
very high. Any future disruption could impact growth for a particular period of time.
