Capability:
Value is created through what a company  does its capabilities rather than what  it has or sells only when you identify  what you are great at and how this  greatness matches with market needs do  you have a value creating strategy let's  discuss what we actually mean by a  capability a capability is a combination  of processes tools and systems knowledge  skills and behaviors and organization  that allows a company to deliver a  specified outcome this means  capabilities are messy complicated  combinations of many factors companies  may have hundreds of capabilities such  as the capability to invoice customers  the capability to procure office  stationery the capability to pay  employees and so on but there are only a  handful of capabilities that are truly  essential for their business success and  at which they need to be better than  anyone else  this is what we call the differentiating  capabilities for these differentiating  capabilities to develop their full  potential they need to work together in  a system however for now we'll focus on  what an individual capability looks like  in practice when successful let's take a  look at the famous chips and snack brand  frito-lay and its direct store delivery  capability direct store delivery is a  method of delivering products from a  supplier directly to a retail store  without going through a retailer's  distribution center DSD is not  considered a highly differentiated  capability today for everyone  many consumer packaged goods companies  use it but frito-lay has managed to  maintain a clear advantage in getting  the right product to the right place at  the right time how do they do this the  processes that give it this capability  include the structuring of drivers jobs  how many and what stores they go to to  strike a balance between driving time in  store time and truck utilization but  what really distinguishes Frito Lays DSD  processes is their high degree of  standardization and end-to-end  integration with zero tolerance for any  features that may compromise frontline  focus or executional excellence every  sales person knows exact  what is required of them and what  process they are required to follow on  every visit its this execution framework  that turns Frito Lays DSD force into a  well-oiled machine tools and systems  adds to this capability frito-lay are  said to have invented the handheld  computer to enable its DSD capability  each salesperson is equipped with a  device that has become an indispensable  tool and information source it walks the  salesperson through his or her pitch in  real time suggests a highly accurate  order based on previous orders and  actual store inventory levels and  updates the sales persons performance  versus quota before and after each call  the handheld computer also supports  micro marketing and helps the  salesperson develop tailored solutions  for individual stores meanwhile Frito  Lays knowledge skills and behaviors that  support this capability include the way  drivers are able to build relations with  store owners identify and secure  incremental shelf space in key areas of  the store and build promotional displays  in addition frontline regional managers  behave like owners and feel empowered to  make local decisions to win the  competitive battle on a store buy store  level then there's the organization of  frito-lay it combines sales driving  delivering and merchandising into  drivers jobs it operates their fleet of  15,000 trucks that visit 400,000  customers across the u.s. the  organization has few layers and highly  decentralized decision rights in order  to maximize effective responsiveness to  competitive and customer dynamics at a  regional and local level also the  incentive plan of the DSD force is  closely linked with the sales of  products at the stores in summary this  specific direct store delivery  capability helps make frito-lay  one of the best performing globally  distributed snack food companies in the  world so you can see why this capability  matters and to repeat the key message a  capability is a combination of processes  tools and systems knowledge skills and  behaviors and organization that allows a  company to deliver a specified outcome  you
Way to Play:
A company’s way to play is an approach to creating value for its customers. A well-defined way to play is broad enough to allow flexibility and growth, but narrow enough to focus strategy and decision making. It may involve being an innovator, a value player, or an experience provider. More than any other single factor, the way to play distinguishes a company from its competitors. Example: Walmart, the largest retail chain in the world, has taken its leading position with a precise and inspiring way to play: being a big-box provider of everything from groceries to electronics to houseplants at “everyday low prices,” without special sales or discounts.



Capabilities System:

A company’s primary source of advantage is a system of three to six mutually reinforcing capabilities that together allow it to fulfill its way to play. A capability is a key strength of your business that customers value and competitors can’t beat. It’s not a generic activity, but a specific intersection of people, knowledge, IT, tools, and processes where your organization consistently out-performs competitors and that delivers a central aspect of your way to play.

Example: Walmart’s capabilities system includes:

-Efficient supply chain management, aggressive vendor management, expert point-of-sale data analytics, superior logistics, and working-capital management
-Mastery of real estate selection and acquisition
-Sophisticated retail conception and design

Most companies make the mistake of composing product and service portfolios based on short-term financial performance and shoehorn a strategy to fit around that portfolio, rather than create a portfolio that aligns with their strategy. We help clients succeed over the long term by aligning their products and services with their capabilities as part of a sustainable growth strategy.
Example: Walmart knows the importance of aligning every product and service it sells with its way to play. Walmart does not sell big-ticket items like large furniture and appliances, where it has no cost advantage.


Right-to-win:
A company’s right to win means its ability to compete in a particular area with the confidence to succeed and create value. It belongs to coherent companies, those that focus on what they do best in making every decision across every business and that align their way to play with their capabilities system and their product and service fit.
Example: Walmart has a well-defined way to play: an unbeatable system of capabilities that reinforce one another, and a portfolio of products and services that thrive within that system. Moreover, its success story is well known: It has been the largest retail chain in the world for many years. It has more than 11,600 stores worldwide, 2.3 million employees and about 260 million customers visits its stores and e-commerce sites each week. This scale famously allows it to dictate terms to just about any of its suppliers.
